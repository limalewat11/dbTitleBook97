Reprint</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 2-Beginning with the statement that "one is a family finding a place to call home," the text goes on to count to 10, then by 10s to 100, describing various groups as "families": for example, 6 is a family passing bread around, 60 is a family sharing a neighborhood street. The intent seems to be to encourage young readers to feel comfortable and loving with their neighbors and friends, but to call fellow apple pickers a family is to diminish the definition. With all of the literature encouraging children to realize that families come in all shapes-single parents, same-sex parents, mixed races, etc.- this well-meaning book makes the concept a little too broad for the intended age group, who might not yet grasp the idea of a global village. Aside from that, this doesn't work well as a counting book, either. "10 cheering runners round the bases" shows 7 people in the bleachers, one runner, a catcher, and a fielder. All in all, this is one warm-hearted effort that flops.<br><i>Christine A. Moesch, Buffalo and Erie County Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 4-8. "ONE is a family finding a place to call home. / TWO is a family starting a new life of their own. / . . . ONE HUNDRED is a family caring for the fragile universe . . . / and making life better for every ONE on earth." In singsong verse, Ryan uses groups of different kinds of "families" to count from 1 to 10 and then by 10s to 100. Huang's sprightly illustrations reflect Ryan's vision of families as a "patchwork of possibilities." "ONE" is a child sitting on a stoop surrounded by moving boxes. "TWO" is a man dancing with a gurgling baby. "ONE HUNDRED" is a group of children and adults picking up and fixing up a central lot. All are families created and connected by bonds of love, blood, friendship, or community. Comforting in that it presents and embraces a world in which every form of family is welcome, this thematic counting book is an appropriate selection for story-hour programs that focus on both traditional and nontraditional "families" and for patrons' increasingly frequent requests for such material. <i>Annie Ayres</i></p><h2>A Plague on Both Your Houses (Matthew Bartholomew Chronicles)</h2><p>In the tradition of Ellis Peters, A Plague on Both Your Houses introduces the physician Matthew Bartholomew, whose unorthodox but effective treatment of his patients frequently draws accusations of heresy from his more traditional colleagues. Besides his practice, Bartholomew is teacher of Medicine at Michaelhouse, part of the fledgling University of Cambridge. In 1348, the inhabitants of Cambridge live under the shadow of a terrible pestilence that has ravaged Europe and is travelling relentlessly eastward towards England. Bartholomew, however, is distracted by the sudden and inexplicable death of the Master of Michaelhouse - a death the University authorities do not want investigated. When three more scholars die in mysterious circumstances, Bartholomew defies the University and begins his own enquiry. His pursuit for the truth leads him into a complex tangle of lies and intrigue that causes him to question the innocence of his closest friends, and even his family. And then the Black Death finally arrives and Bartholomew is dragged deeper and deeper into a quagmire which threatens not only his life, but the continued existence of the University and the future of the town.</p><p><p>Susanna Gregory was a police officer in Leeds before taking up an academic career.

E. B. Griffin is the author of five other bestselling series: The Corps, Brotherhood of War, Badge of Honor, Men at War, and Honor Bound.THE SHOOTERS is the fourth book in Griffin's Presidential Agent series. Delta Force Officer Charley Castillo and his ever-expanding band of clandestine warriors follow a presidential order to find and rescue a DEA agent kidnapped by drug traffickers in Paraguay. Narrator Dick Hill presents a crisp, well-articulated reading of this typical Griffin story, which is packed with exciting characters and situations. Hill's effectiveness as a narrator is apparent, but dealing with the different personalities and accents does present some challenges. Still, THE SHOOTERS is a must for Griffin fans and will also have wide appeal to newcomers to the series.

Board of Education&#34;, &#34;Mapp v. Ohio&#34;, and &#34;Miranda v. Arizona.&#34; A Republican who eschewed the party line to support many centrist and liberal decisions, Warren&#39;s views were often surprising and controversial, informed as they were by his personal sense of fairness rather than politics. In his Memoirs, Warren recounts his years as a district attorney and attorney general in San Francisco, and his three terms as California&#39;s governor. Writing of his years as a Justice of the Supreme Court, Warren reveals Eisenhower&#39;s anger at him for being soft on Communism during the McCarthy era, and a run-in with Attorney General John Mitchell and the Nixon Department of Justice, who attempted to discretely influence a Supreme Court decision.</p><p>Earl Warren (1891-1974) was elected Governor of California three times and served as a Justice on the Supreme Court from 1953-1969. His other works include <i>A Republic, If You Can Keep It</i>.[Warren's] style is simple and direct, garnished with political and personal anecdotes that are outspoken but not malicious. His own attractive qualities include a keen sense of honor, the gift of getting to the heart of complex issues, and a sense of humor. These add up to a book of considerable eminence. (<i>The New Yorker</i> )<br><br>Much has been written about the 'Warren Court' and its chief justice. But these memoirs provide valuable new insight, not only into the workings of the court but, more important, into the upbringing and early career which molded Earl Warren the jurist.

That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m delighted to see the release of Crossway&#x2019;s Christian Guides to the Classics. Now, I&#x2019;ve got a boost to my confidence, a feasible course in front of me, and a world-class guide to assist along the way. In fact, Dr. Leland Ryken could scale these peaks in his sleep, having, for decades now, guided hundreds of students to a greater appreciation for the Classics. Lee combines scholarly acumen and Christian faith with uncluttered thinking and crystal-clear style in a way that virtually guarantees no one will get tangled-up in woods or wander off trail.

These guides offer exactly the kind of resources needed to empower high school and college students (whether in public, private, classical-Christian, or home schools) to connect with the Great Books and to ask the kinds of questions that we all must ask if we are to understand our full status as creatures made in the image of God who have fallen but who can be redeemed.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Louis Markos</strong><strong>,</strong> Professor of English and Scholar in Residence, Houston Baptist University; author, <em>From Achilles to Christ </em>and<em> Literature: A Student&#x2019;s Guide</em></p><p>&#x201c;It is hard to imagine a better guide than Leland Ryken to help readers navigate the classics.

However, this night things are a little different. This night its residents are bustling about, barring doors and shuttering windows. Because this night a once-in-a-generation Shadow Moon is due and threatens the good citizens of Malaz with demon hounds and other, darker, beings...<br><br>And it was also prophesied that on this night the Emperor Kellanved, missing for all these years, would return. As factions within the greater Empire battle over the imperial throne, the Shadow Moon summons a far more alien and ancient presence for an all-out assault upon the island. Indeed, the cataclysmic events that happen this night will determine the fate of the Malaz and of the entire world beyond.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Ian Cameron Esslemont was born in 1962 in Winnipeg and now lives in Alaska with his family. He is currently completing a Ph.D in Literature and writing a second novel set in the world of Malaz.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Starred Review. Steven Erickson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series only hints at the empire's distant history, which Esslemont, cocreator of the original world, explores in this dark, powerful novel (first published in the U.K. in 2004) and its planned sequels. On a Shadow Moon night on the Isle of Malaz, dead souls rise and demonlike hounds attack any who dare to leave their homes. Knowing that Emperor Kellanved is prophesied to use the Shadow Moon for his own ends, the emperor's enemies gather on the small island for their own nefarious purposes, starting a plot that spirals into bloody violence. Esslemont nails the feel and flavor of Erickson's books and brings the historical characters to life with a dexterity that will win over even the most skeptical fans. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jackson, a young farmer whose family is forced to abandon their farm and seek a new life in California.<br><br>April 10, 1935<br><br>The dust has been blowing bad for several years in a row now. And with crop failures coming back to back like they have, hundreds of families have lost their farms. A Monday never passes without Sheriff Jake Allison posting a notice of foreclosure at the Boise City courthouse. Times are so rough, that when they hold an auction to sell a place, the only people that show up are the banks and the insurance companies. Nobody else has a nickel.<br><br>C.J. Jackson is a young man living through one of the most tragic times in the Dust Bowl of an America fraught with political, economic, and environmental problems. In this intense journal of life in the Oklahoma panhandle, C.J. tells it like it is-and it is bad.</p><p>Grade 4-7-The Jacksons live in the epicenter of the worst dust storm in American history, so they are forced to abandon their beloved farm and make the arduous journey to California in search of work. The teen chronicles the discrimination, disappointment, and hardship that thousands of "Okies" endured. A historical note and a selection of captioned, black-and-white photos round out the book. While this novel lacks the power and eloquence of Karen Hesse's Out of the Dust (Scholastic, 1997), C. J. is an authentic and likable protagonist. Durbin effectively conveys the plight of Dust Bowl families, from the horrendous conditions in the camps to the demeaning and demanding life of a migrant worker. It's likely that readers' curiosity will be piqued enough to learn more about the Depression, and that they will have a greater appreciation for John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath when they encounter it.<br><i>Ronni Krasnow, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ancient China (See Through History)</h2><p>Double-page see-through spreads reveal the customs and daily lives of the ancient Chinese with depictions of a warrior-king&#39;s tomb, a nobleman&#39;s house, boat and locks on China&#39;s Grand Canal, and the private palace of a Ming emperor.</p><p>Grade 6-9. The finely detailed, full-color illustrations are the most outstanding feature of both of these titles. The clear plastic overlays that allow readers to see inside a typical Chinese house or an Inca temple are an unnecessary gimmick. Each book begins with an introductory double-page chapter and a map. A chronology helps orient readers to the vast sweep of Chinese history. Subsequent chapters cover such topics as farming, religion, clothing, architecture, and many aspects of daily life. The overly ambitious spread devoted to "The World Outside" traces the end of the Manchu Dynasty (1912), the Cultural Revolution, and the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in a couple of sentences. This last event is mentioned without any explanation. The Incas devotes the final two chapters to the Spanish conquest, certainly a tale told elsewhere, but rarely with such fine illustrations. Appendixes contain a list of key dates and a brief glossary. These books will be useful for reports or as introductions to the subjects.?David N. Pauli, Missoula Public Library, MT<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.This entry in the See Through History series chronicles major events and periods from 3,500 years of the world's oldest continuous culture. Beginning with the Shang dynasty in the Bronze Age, Williams covers war, daily life, religious beliefs, farming, burial, class structure, civil service, cities, homes, and many other aspects of culture and custom, gradually working forward to the modern era. Interspersed throughout is information about the various dynasties and empires, as well as four spreads with transparent overlays, showing the exteriors and interiors of buildings, etc. These are terrific and readers will wish for more of them, and page back and forth for every detail. Lavishly illustrated and dense with information, this is a noteworthy volume. (map, chronology, glossary, index) (Nonfiction. 8-12) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Thus begins this powerful essay; Uses of the Erotic defines the power of the erotic, names the process by which women have been stripped of this power, and considers how women can reclaim it. Uses of the Erotic shines among Audre Lorde&#39;s powerful legacy of speeches and essays, and has influenced feminist thinking for more than 15 years. The false dichotomies that Lorde debunks persist in our cultural imagination: the separation of the erotic from the spiritual and political. Now, Kore Press brings this essay into stand-alone focus, reprinting it in a fine, handbound pamphlet illustrated with photographs by Tucson photographer Camille Bonzani. Designed by book artist Nancy Solomon, the essay is offset and letterpress printed in an edition of 1000.</p><p>Part of a series of short essays designed to be sent in the mail like a greeting card, envelope included. in their matching brown mailing envelope.Audre Lorde was born in 1934 in New York to parents of West Indian heritage. She passed away in 1992, a victim of breast cancer. Her battle with the disease, which was chronicled in &#34;The Cancer Journals,&#34; was just one of many struggles she had to deal with in life. Audre Lorde, a black lesbian feminist, fought for justice on multiple fronts. Her writings protest against the swallowing of black American culture by an indifferent white population, against the perpetuation of sex discrimination, and against the neglect of the movement for gay rights. Audre Lorde also held numerous teaching positions and toured the world as a lecturer. She formed coalitions between Afro-German and Afro-Dutch women, founded a sisterhood in South Africa, began Women of Color Press, and established the St. Croix Women&#39;s Coalition. She was living in St.Croix at the time of her death.</p><h2>A Politically Incorrect Feminist: Creating a Movement with Bitches, Lunatics, Dykes, Prodigies, Warriors, and Wonder Women</h2><p><p><b>A powerful and revealing memoir about the pioneers of modern-day feminism</b><br><b></b><br>Phyllis Chesler was a pioneer of Second Wave Feminism. Chesler and the women who came out swinging between 1972-1975 integrated the want ads, brought class action lawsuits on behalf of economic discrimination, opened rape crisis lines and shelters for battered women, held marches and sit-ins for abortion and equal rights, famously took over offices and buildings, and pioneered high profile Speak-outs. They began the first-ever national and international public conversations about birth control and abortion, sexual harassment, violence against women, female orgasm, and a woman&#x2019;s right to kill in self-defense. </p><p>Now, Chesler has juicy stories to tell. The feminist movement has changed over the years, but Chesler knew some of its first pioneers, including Gloria Steinem, Kate Millett, Flo Kennedy, and Andrea Dworkin. These women were fierce forces of nature, smoldering figures of sin and soul, rock stars and action heroes in real life. Some had been viewed as whores, witches, and madwomen, but were changing the world and becoming major players in history.

The chapter "Sorely Afflicted Feminist Geniuses" is unusually candid, bold, and fair. The obituary of the late great Kate Millett is eye-opening and worthy of praise in itself.

What&#x2019;s new in Chesler&#x2019;s memoir is the assertion that mental illness plagued a significant number of the leading figures of the women&#x2019;s movement. Chapter 11 (itself worth the price of the book) explains how she came from a position of refusing to consider that feminists could be mentally ill to acknowledging that &#x201c;some of our most beloved geniuses&#x201d; were &#x201c;clinically schizophrenic or manic depressive, suicidal, addicted to drugs or alcohol, etc.&#x201d; She points out that the same has been true for many great male artists." &#x2015;<b>Martha Shelley, Author of <i>The Throne in the Heart of the Sea</i></b> </p><p>"Marvelous.

In March 1997, the Notorious B.I.G. was similarly shot after an awards show in Los Angeles. Neither crime has ever been solved. Also in 1997, highly decorated LAPD detective Russell Poole uncovered evidence that certain officers in the department were moonlighting for Death Row Records&#x2015;and, when he was placed on the task force assigned to the Notorious B.I.G.&#x2019;s murder, evidence that these same men were linked to the murders. The first book to bring this story out of the shadows, <i>LAbyrinth</i> received critical acclaim, ignited a firestorm of controversy, and prompted two lawsuits against the LAPD. Now the basis for the major motion picture <i>City of Lies</i> and updated with new material from the author, <i>LAbyrinth</i> is a compelling tale of a grave miscarriage of justice.</p></p><p><b>Randall Sullivan</b> was a contributing editor to <i>Rolling Stone</i> for over twenty years. He is the author of <i>The Price of Experience</i>, <i>LAbyrinth</i>, <i>The Miracle Detective</i>, and <i>Untouchable</i>. His work has been published in, among many other places, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Outside</i>, <i>Men&#x2019;s Journal</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, and the <i>Guardian</i>. He lives in Oregon.Sullivan (The Price of Experience) strikes again in the arena of California true crime, exploring the sordid world of big money, gangsta rap, guns and drugs. Opening with the shooting of a black man by a white man during a traffic incident, Sullivan underscores the not-so-well-known racial tempest brewing on the West Coast especially when he reveals that the shooter was an undercover narcotics investigator and the man killed was an off-duty L.A.P.D. officer who moonlighted for the disreputable Death Row Records. From here, Sullivan outlines the bad and the ugly of the music industry: mafioso-style music label management; the unsolved murders of rap superstars Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G.; and a dizzying series of binary oppositions Crips vs. Bloods; West Coast rappers vs. East Coast rappers; Death Row Records' exec Suge Knight vs. Puffy Combs of Bad Boy Records, etc. Unfortunately, the basic material isn't exactly new; journalists Ronin Ro and Cathy Scott, among others, have previously covered the murders of Shakur and B.I.G. Still, Sullivan's reportorial writing style accurately reflects the investigative work of homicide gumshoe Russell Poole while building the drama within the truly labyrinthine political coverups, cop-to-criminal crossovers and the breaks in the L.A.P.D.'s code of silence.

He has left behind his career and his girlfriend, Lorena, to pay self-imposed penance for an awful misstep on an old murder case. But the old ghosts are about to come roaring back.<br><br>There are plenty of difficult actors in Hollywood, and then there's Alastair Pinch. <br><br>Alastair is a onetime Royal Shakespeare Company thespian who now slums it as the "wise" Southern judge on a tacky network show. He's absurdly rich, often belligerent, and typically drunk--a damning combination when Alastair's wife is found dead on their living room floor and he can't remember what happened. <br><br>Waldo's old flame Lorena, hiding peril of her own, draws him toward the case, and Alastair's greedy network convinces Waldo to take it on. But after such a long time away from both civilization and sleuthing--and plagued by a confounding array of assailants who want him gone--Waldo must navigate complicated webs of ego and deceit to clear Alastair's name . . . or confirm his guilt.</p><p><b>Howard Michael Gould</b> began his career on Madison Avenue before moving to Los Angeles, where he has worked as a screenwriter and playwright as well as executive producer and head writer on a number of network comedies. <i>Last Looks</i> is his first novel.One<br><br> As he scrubbed one sock in the day's supply of well water, noting that his stitches had not held and the hole in the toe had reopened, he considered once again the problem of the One Hundred Things, as he had every day, every hour of every day, for the past three years.<br><br> The wash bucket was a Thing, as was the work shirt he'd just scrubbed, as were the boxers. He knew some minimalists counted all of their clothing as one Thing, but not the serious ones. So the shirt and jeans and boxers he was wearing right now were three more Things, and the windbreaker slung over the post behind him was a fourth. Those were simple. Socks, though-socks were more complicated, drawing him into the tricky land of plurals and singulars and naming, where the line between reason and rationalization was the disputed border in nothing less than a war for his soul.<br><br> That battle had raged ever since he resolved to pare his possessions down to the One Hundred. His books, he had decided then, were not One Library, they were dozens and dozens of Things, so he donated them all to a home for indigent seniors and bought a Kindle. But the pins and needles and tiny spools of polyester and the needle threader-they were fairly elements of One Sewing Kit. Those choices were the stuff of certainty and easy conscience, true to the organizing principle of his life and the purpose of his days, the slim reed he'd grasped during the worst of times, the redemptive positive he'd built on a simple catechism of negatives:<br><br> Don't want, don't acquire, don't require.<br><br> Don't affect.<br><br> Don't hurt.<br><br> Ah, but socks. Back when he was whittling down his final list, struggling to find eight more Things he could live without, he decided, not without guilt, that his four industrial-strength boot socks were Two Things, not Four, that a pair of socks was a pair of socks, rather than a pair of socks, just as a pair of boxers was not in fact a pair. That decision helped him get down to the One Hundred, but it still gnawed at him some days.<br><br> Today was one of those days, what with one sock almost beyond repair yet its mate still good and sturdy. He could take out his iPhone, that indispensable Thing, and order another pair, but that would leave him with two untenable choices: either worsen the planet's landfill problem by throwing a perfectly good sock into the black trash bin (not one of the Hundred Things, since it belonged to Riverside County) and dragging it down the dirt road, or hang on to the good sock to couple with one of his others when its mate wore out-which in the meantime would leave him stuck with a hundred and first Thing, so that was no choice at all.<br><br> Maybe if he biked into Idyllwild, he could buy a pair there and find a Goodwill center and donate the good sock. But in his heart he knew that would be phony solace, that someone else would just throw the widow sock in the garbage. The very thought reminded him that when the socks originally arrived he had read on the label that they were ten percent something called polypropylene.<br><br> Such were the problems on Charlie Waldo's mind when he heard the tires in the distance, turning off the asphalt and onto the dirt road that serviced his twelve acres of wooded mountainside.<br><br> Nobody but Rico the mail carrier had been on Waldo's property in the years since he'd moved here, and that only when a package wouldn't fit in the roadside box. He tried to remember whether the last time had been just over or just under a year ago, when Waldo had ordered a sack of feed for his chickens. He realized that was the last time he had spoken to anyone aloud, and he wondered whether he'd have to talk to Rico now, or whether a polite thank-you nod would be enough.<br><br> Then he worried what the mailman might be carrying, because the last thing Waldo needed was a Thing.<br><br> A cloud of dust blew into the clearing ahead of the mail truck, obscuring for a moment that it wasn't a mail truck at all but a sleek Porsche 911, metallic blue. Waldo absently dropped the holey sock into the wash bucket and stood to watch the coupe approach, squinting into the sun. The Porsche pulled to a stop thirty feet away, but he had to shield his eyes from the blowing dirt and the gleam, so he recognized her first by her voice.<br><br> "Jesus, Waldo."<br><br> When he did see her face, he realized that he hadn't thought about his own appearance in a very long time-a mirror was one of the last Things he'd shucked to get down to One Hundred-so he could only imagine what three years without a haircut or shave must have done to him.<br><br> And here was head-turning Lorena, who had to be thirty now, standing in front of him in the swirling dust in a leather jacket and ankle boots and designer jeans, thick black hair still past her shoulders, taking off her oversize designer sunglasses and shaking her head slowly with a cool smirk, as if none of it had ever happened, as if Waldo had never felt compelled to break his own heart by breaking hers.<br><br> She said it again: "Jesus, Waldo." Only now she was walking past him, past his pond, to his miniature cabin. It was just sixteen feet by eight, like some playhouse imitation of a folk Victorian, seated at the edge of a forest, straight out of a fairy tale but for the solar panels and satellite dish. "You live in this? Seriously?"<br><br> "The average American h-" His voice broke, unfamiliar to itself. He tried again. "The average American home puts out eighteen tons of greenhouse gases per year. A hundred twenty-eight square feet is enough for anyone."<br><br> "You got plumbing?"<br><br> "I harvest rainwater."<br><br> "In California?"<br><br> "And there's a spring if I need it."<br><br> "Damn." She looked the house up and down. "Well, if anyone's hard-ass enough to put himself through this shit . . ." She let the thought hang there and started inside uninvited.<br><br> "Hey!" He trotted after her.<br><br> Waldo had to wait in the doorway while she inspected the tiny space, a normal home ingeniously compacted to the size of a freshman dorm room, the wood unfinished, the shelves shallow, the walls crammed with cookware and cutlery and any other of the Hundred Things that could be hung. The kitchen was a two-burner stove set atop a waist-high closet with a small fridge and toaster oven, all squeezed next to a tiny sink fed by a ceramic water jug.<br><br> "My new place, I got a walk-in closet bigger than this. What's up here?" Lorena started up a ladder to a tiny loft.<br><br> "That's where I sleep." Waldo knew she'd note the folded blanket; even though he never had company, only neatness and precision made life in this space tolerable, and he was as unforgiving about housekeeping as about all other aspects of his life.<br><br> Still on the ladder, Lorena twisted and took in the whole tiny room. "Where's all your stuff?"<br><br> "I've divested. Got myself down to a hundred things. You'd be amazed what you can live without."<br><br> "Like a badge?" Waldo took the poke without response. She pressed. "You got a gun, at least?" He shook his head. "Jesus, Waldo." She climbed down and continued her inspection. "I see you still got a MacBook. Guess you could've answered an email." Before he could find an answer, she asked, "How much land this mansion sitting on?"<br><br> "Almost twelve acres."<br><br> "Show it to me."<br><br> She followed him outside and into the trees. Waldo, pulling on his windbreaker, tromped through the woods he knew so well he could manage in the dark, so shaken in the presence of another, even her, maybe especially her, that he pulled way ahead, incognizant of her struggle through the underbrush in three-inch heels. "The agency's grown," she said, having to raise her voice. "I've got three ops full-time, three more freelance. You surprised?"<br><br> "Not even a little." It was a compliment, but it rang as something else, as a conversation ender, all the more so when Waldo picked up his pace, extending his lead in silence. He didn't want to make conversation, didn't know how anymore. It felt wrong; it felt cheap. Anyway, he was allowed to be a bad host. He hadn't invited her. He hadn't invited anyone. That was the point.<br><br> When she spoke next he wasn't sure he heard her correctly-she was far behind now, and it seemed too random. It sounded like she said, "Alastair Pinch." He knew the name, of course, which he'd been seeing every day online in the headlines of the L.A. Times. But Waldo stayed away from those kinds of stories.<br><br> "Alastair Pinch?" she repeated, a little louder, and added, "The actor?"<br><br> "Who killed his wife."<br><br> "I guess you use that MacBook." She continued. "Maybe he killed her, maybe he didn't. Even he doesn't know-he's a blackout drunk."<br><br> She's on a case, Waldo thought, and wants help. But why would she need it? She's talented, she's got ops, she sure as hell can't be looking for his connections at the LAPD anymore. Unless she's not really looking for help, unless the help was an excuse to come. Either way, he wasn't interested. He walked even faster.<br><br> "Could you slow down?" she called. He stopped and turned. She resumed her pitch as she closed the gap. "His network's got a lot riding on him. They hired a lawyer: Fontella Davis."<br><br> "Fontella Davis. So he did kill her."<br><br> "It means the money's serious. And they're looking to hire a PI. This gig would jump me to the majors. Problem is, nobody's giving me that shot: woman, my age, midsize agency. But . . . if I could deliver the famous Charlie Waldo to work it with me . . ." She smiled at him. "You know these Hollywood types: always want to put a big name in it."<br><br> So that was it: she was here to make a business proposition, with the added benefit of showing Waldo that she'd survived and then some, that she was a success, and so completely over him that she could even handle working side by side. He realized he was glad for her on both counts. But he didn't want her getting the idea he wanted her here, so all he said was "I'm retired."<br><br> "From the force. Lot of ex-cops go PI. You'd be investigating a murder. What's the difference who signs the check?"<br><br> Waldo started walking again, this time dragging a little so she could keep up. "Difference is, cop's job is get the bad guy. PI's job is get the bad guy off."<br><br> "Unless he isn't the bad guy. You don't even have to put in for a license; you can work under mine." A sharp light, a reflection, cut through the trees. "What is that?"<br><br> She walked straight toward the light, ahead of Waldo now, into a clearing, where she found the elephant, a modernist sculpture of sheet metal, anomalously placed in the middle of nowhere. Lorena circled it, studying, then turned to Waldo for an explanation.<br><br> "They say an artist owned this land in the seventies." He laid a hand on the elephant's gleaming flank. "It's why I bought the property, actually. It spoke to me."<br><br> Lorena looked him straight in the eye, her lip curling into that sly, lopsided grin of hers, the one that said she knew everything about him and that started him thinking about some other things he'd gone without. She said, "Oh, I know why it spoke to you." She ran the fingers of one hand suggestively along the elephant's upturned trunk, never breaking eye contact. Waldo, nonplussed, wondered if her flirting was obtuse or if he was simply way out of practice. As if she could tell he needed the help, she explained. "One of those times we were supposedly 'broken up,' I was coming out of the art museum on Wilshire with a date and ran into you?" Waldo shook his head like he couldn't recall what she was talking about, even though he did. Lorena had ditched the guy on the spot and she and Waldo had all but run to the back seat of his truck in the parking garage. "Yeah," she said now, taunting, "try and play like you don't remember."<br><br> "What does that have to do with this?"<br><br> "The parking garage was right next to the La Brea Tar Pits. By the mammoths."<br><br> She started back into the woods, pleased with herself.<br><br> She'd ruffled him, the way only Lorena could. It had been a long time since he'd felt that, and he didn't like it. "Wait, wait, wait." Now he was the one scrambling to keep up with her. "First of all, this isn't a mammoth; it's an elephant. Second, are you saying I bought this property because I had some subconscious sexual memory prompted by this sculpture-"<br><br> "-which you walked me straight to, the minute I came to visit you-"<br><br> "-uninvited."<br><br> "Wasn't Detective Waldo's first rule 'There are no accidents'?" She kept walking.<br><br> He stopped, flummoxed, then started after her, insisting, "It's not a mammoth."<br><br> As they walked in silence back toward Waldo's cabin, side by side now, he didn't have to look at her to know she held on to that self-satisfied look the whole way. It was rattling and it was comfortable, which was worse. He wanted her to leave.<br><br> When they reached the clearing, she stopped walking and finally spoke. "So, this case: we'll go eighty-twenty, yours."<br><br> He knew he wouldn't take the deal but couldn't resist asking, "Why would you do that?"<br><br> "Because this is the biggest thing since O.J. It'll totally blow me up. And I've got too much marital. I want to branch out."<br><br> Waldo shook his head. "What would I even do with the money?"<br><br> "Buy a nicer hundred things."<br><br> "Pass."<br><br> She stood close to him, and Waldo wondered if she expected him to kiss her. He hoped not. He broke the moment and walked toward her car.<br><br> "You got any friends up here?" she asked. "You go into town? Anything?" Waldo shifted his weight, wondering what else he could do to hurry her into her car and back down the mountain. But she kept talking. "Lydell was a long time ago, Waldo. You don't have to keep punishing yourself. You don't have to live like this."<br><br> It pushed a button and his anger flashed, seeing her with her Porsche, everything he hated about the world, everything he'd rejected, and the words were out of his mouth before he had a chance to think about them. "You don't have to live like that."</p><h2>The Great Pyramid Decoded</h2><p>The greatest archaeological discovery of all times decoded after 4500 years reveals geometric construction scientific features astronomical designs and pre-dates recorded knowledge by thousands of years.

Recounted in visceral, kinetic prose, and crafted with a forthrightness that rejects piety, cynicism, and self-pity, it brings us face-to-face with a provocative new understanding of the nature of addiction and the meaning of recovery.<br><br>By the time he entered a drug and alcohol treatment facility, James Frey had taken his addictions to near-deadly extremes. He had so thoroughly ravaged his body that the facility�s doctors were shocked he was still alive. The ensuing torments of detoxification and withdrawal, and the never-ending urge to use chemicals, are captured with a vitality and directness that recalls the seminal eye-opening power of William Burroughs�s Junky.<br><br>But<i> A Million Little Pieces</i> refuses to fit any mold of drug literature. Inside the clinic, James is surrounded by patients as troubled as he is -- including a judge, a mobster, a one-time world-champion boxer, and a fragile former prostitute to whom he is not allowed to speak � but their friendship and advice strikes James as stronger and truer than the clinic�s droning dogma of How to Recover. James refuses to consider himself a victim of anything but his own bad decisions, and insists on accepting sole accountability for the person he has been and the person he may become--which runs directly counter to his counselors' recipes for recovery.<br><br>James has to fight to find his own way to confront the consequences of the life he has lived so far, and to determine what future, if any, he holds. It is this fight, told with the charismatic energy and power of<i> One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nes</i>t, that is at the heart of<i> A Million Little Pieces:</i> the fight between one young man�s will and the ever-tempting chemical trip to oblivion, the fight to survive on his own terms, for reasons close to his own heart. <br><br><i>A Million Little Pieces </i>is an uncommonly genuine account of a life destroyed and a life reconstructed. It is also the introduction of a bold and talented literary voice.<br><i>From the eBook edition.</i></p><h2>Drivers Seat</h2><p>Lise, driven to distraction by an office job, leaves everything and flies south on holiday - in search of passionate adventure, the obsessional experience and sex.

Norman Geisler and Joseph Holden contend it is "because American high school students are on the front line of the spiritual war between persons who worship God and those who seek to cultivate a world apart from God." Students are being attacked on every flank&#x2014;through movies, music, television, friends, and, yes, even in the classroom where a Judeo-Christian worldview is presented as antiquated, if presented at all. Now, more than ever, young Christians need to be prepared to defend their faith against the onslaught of lies and humanistic propaganda that so saturates our culture today. Authors Geisler and Holden lay a firm foundation so every student can feel bold and confident in defending their faith.</p><p><b>Joseph M.

In the early twentieth century, scientists took sides. One held that the entire universe was contained in the Milky Way galaxy. Their champion was the strong-willed astronomer Harlow Shapley. Another camp believed that the universe was so vast that the Milky Way was just one galaxy among billions&#x2015;the view that would prevail, proven by the equally headstrong Edwin Hubble.<br><br> Almost forgotten is the Harvard Observatory "computer"&#x2015;a human number cruncher hired to calculate the positions and luminosities of stars in astronomical photographs&#x2015;who found the key to the mystery. Radcliffe-educated Henrietta Swan Leavitt, fighting ill health and progressive deafness, stumbled upon a new law that allowed astronomers to use variable stars&#x2015;those whose brightness rhythmically changes&#x2015;as a cosmic yardstick. <em>Miss Leavitt's Stars</em> is both a masterly account of how we measure the universe and the moving story of a neglected genius<br> 10 illustrations</p><p>George Johnson, an award-winning science journalist, is the author of several books, most recently The Cancer Chronicles and Strange Beauty. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.In the early 1900s the "computers" at the Harvard University Observatory were women, paid 25 cents an hour to pore over photographic plates taken with the university's telescope and to catalogue changes in the sizes and locations of stars. Henrietta Leavitt was an unmarried clergyman's daughter who began working at the observatory soon after graduating from Radcliffe. The director quickly recognized her skill and made generous allowances for the long absences occasioned by her apparently delicate health and family problems. <i>New York Times </i>science writer Johnson (<i>Strange Beauty</i>) relates that Leavitt's singular contribution to astronomy came when she recognized that cyclical changes in the size of Cepheids, giant variable stars, could be correlated with their luminosity. Once luminosity was known, a star's distance from Earth could be calculated. Leavitt wasn't interested in pushing her discovery to its logical conclusion, but other astronomers quickly grasped the ramifications for calculating the size of the Milky Way and the universe. In recent years, Leavitt has joined Rosalind Franklin in receiving long overdue recognition. Scant documentation exists for Leavitt's life aside from correspondence with the observatory, so readers shouldn't be surprised to discover that this excellent book is more about the search to measure the universe than about Leavitt's life. Nevertheless, it's a fine tribute to a remarkable woman of science. 10 illus. not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>Agent, Esther Newberg.</i><i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The real contributions here are in Mitgutsch's artwork, which not only represents plot developments but illustrates peripheral concepts. For example, endpapers and other spreads constitute virtual pictorial encyclopedias of medieval objects (pennon, coronal, lozenge tip), pastimes (tilting at a dummy during jousting practice, archery instruction), etc. Other art depicts medieval technology (e.g., how roofs are removed from castle towers to aid in defending the building from marauders). Color and broad lines are favored over detail and precision. The work, accordingly, is more atmospheric than realistic, but one has only to examine the foldout center spread to appreciate the merits of this tradeoff.

Introductory chapters define terms of appreciation. While other wines may be drunk for mere enjoyment, Kramer ( Making Sense of Wine ) notes that the charge of Burgundy wine is to pay homage to special qualities of the "minerally or stoney; chalky or earthy" Burgundian terrain. To the extent that they bring out the "earth" in a wine, Kramer defends such techniques as sulfuring and chaptalization (or "sugaring"). He evaluates site characteristics and winemaking techniques of each identifiable estate within the region's districts, conferring his findings in 400 pages of agreeably travel-guide-like text. But in evaluating Burgundies, Kramer struggles, as all wine writers must, with adjectives yearning for context. A wine may be "thickly muscled," "flabby" or "almost brutish in its amplitude." He does not cover the actual technique of tasting, how to cellar or serve Burgundies, or what to serve them with. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kramer's previous book, Making Sense of Wine ( LJ 9/1/89), was a primer for beginning connoisseurs. This second volume of the "Making Sense of . . . " series is aimed at more advanced oenephiles who wish to understand wines from France's Burgundy region. From the vineyards to the wineries and wine shops, Kramer explains the features for which these wines have long been treasured. While naming and discussing producers, he does not make recommendations on specific vintages. However, the author provides a listing of vineyard owners and their holdings. Compiled in 1986 and since removed from public inspection by the French government, these records make Kramer's book a unique guide to one of the industry's best-kept secrets.

Torrance has been called &#34;the greatest Reformed theologian since Karl Barth&#34; and &#34;the greatest British theologian of the twentieth century&#34; by prominent voices in the academy. His work has profoundly shaped contemporary theology in the English-speaking world. This first of two volumes comprises Thomas Torrance&#39;s lectures delivered to students in Christian Dogmatics on Christology at New College, Edinburgh, from 1952 to 1978 and amounts to the most comprehensive presentation of Torrance&#39;s understanding of the incarnation ever published. In eight chapters these expertly edited lectures highlight Torrance&#39;s distinctive belief that the object of our theological study--Jesus Christ--actively gives himself to us in order that we may know him, as well as unpack Torrance&#39;s well-developed understanding of our union with Christ and how it impacts the Christian life. Also included are his reflections on the in-breaking of Christ&#39;s kingdom and its intense conflict with and victory over evil. Decidedly readable and filled with some of Torrence&#39;s most influential thought, this will be an important volume for scholars, professors and students of Christian theology for decades to come.</p><p>&#34;No theologian in the latter half of the twentieth century devoted more attention to the mystery of the incarnation than T. F. Torrance. These magnificent posthumously published lectures give us the most sustained and rounded account of his views that we will ever have. In depth of learning, profundity of insight and purity of faith, nothing comparable has appeared from the pen of an English-speaking theologian since John Henry Newman. This is a towering work that deserves to be read throughout the ecumenical churches, to whose renewal and imperative reunion it promises to make a vital contribution.&#34;Thomas F. Torrance (1913&#x2013;2007) occupied the chair of Christian dogmatics at the University of Edinburgh for twenty-seven years. He was the recipient of the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in 1978, and he served as moderator of the Church of Scotland and coeditor of the <em>Scottish Journal of Theology.</em> He wrote extensively, contributing more than twenty major works of theology and hundreds of articles in a variety of languages.<br><br>Robert T. Walker has degrees in philosophy and theology from Edinburgh University, Scotland. As T. F.

He is a quiet man, a husband and father, a hardworking barber, a kindly landlord to the men who live in a basement apartment in his home. He is a fixture in his Brooklyn neighborhood, recognizable by the terrifying scar on his face. As the book unfolds, moving seamlessly between Haiti in the 1960s and New York City today, we enter the lives of those around him: his devoted wife and rebellious daughter; his sometimes unsuspecting, sometimes apprehensive neighbors, tenants, and clients. And we meet some of his victims.<br><br>In the book&#x2019;s powerful denouement, we return to the Haiti of the dew breaker&#x2019;s past, to his last, desperate act of violence, and to his first encounter with the woman who will offer him a form of redemption&#x2014;albeit imperfect&#x2014;that will change him forever.<br><i>The Dew Breaker</i> is a book of interconnected lives&#x2014;a book of love, remorse, and hope; of rebellions both personal and political; of the compromises we often make in order to move beyond the most intimate brushes with history. Unforgettable, deeply resonant, <i>The Dew Breaker </i>proves once more that in Edwidge Danticat we have a major American writer.</p><p>In her third novel, <i>The Dew Breaker,</i> the prolific Edwidge Danticat spins a series of related stories around a shadowy central figure, a Haitian immigrant to the U.S. who reveals to his artist daughter that he is not, as she believes, a prison escapee, but a former prison guard, skilled in torture and the other violent control methods of a brutal regime. "Your father was the hunter," he confesses, "he was not the prey." Into this brilliant opening, Danticat tucks the seeds of all that follows: the tales of the prison guard's victims, of their families, of those who recognize him decades later on the streets of New York, of those who never see him again, but are so haunted that they believe he's still pursuing them. (A dew breaker, we learn, is a government functionary who comes in the early morning to arrest someone or to burn a house down, breaking the dew on the grass that he crosses.) Although it is frustrating, sometimes, to let go of one narrative thread to follow another, <i>The Dew Breaker</i> is a beautifully constructed novel that spirals back to the reformed prison guard at the end, while holding unanswered the question of redemption. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Edwidge Danticat was born in Haiti and moved to the United States when she was twelve.

It doesn't take long for Frank to find that the official verdict--suicide--is a lot of hooey. (Whatever finally killed Peg, she'd been beaten thoroughly first.) It doesn't take him long to find that the cops are dead serious about burying the case. (A day after Peg's death, they've already closed and vanished the case file, cremated the body, and scattered the ashes at sea.) And it doesn't take him long to find Jane Danner, the comic-strip artist who'll hold his hand and trade quips with Groucho while he's waiting for the trail of blackmail and corruption to lead from blackmailing Peg to organized crime, the Bayside Police Department, and the upper reaches of Monarch Studios. Throughout the starlet-studded proceedings, Groucho is hilarious. Unfortunately, the non sequiturs that pepper his conversation so amusingly seem to have wormed their way into the helter-skelter mystery as well. Historical Hollywood background, celebrity cameos, rapid-fire patter, and ramshackle plotting: Veteran Goulart's series debut is just the thing for readers who think George Baxt and Stuart Kaminsky aren't turning out this sort of product fast enough. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>YA-It's 1937, and Groucho Marx teams up with Frank Denby to solve mysteries. The first appears in a new radio series, written by Denby, in which Groucho stars as a flaky detective who solves crimes using his own wacky techniques. The other one involves the death of a young starlet whom Groucho had known a few years earlier. The comic enlists the help of Denby and eventually Denby's girlfriend, Jane Danner, in his quest to solve the case. Goulart inserts period details throughout the novel. Local gangsters add another view of Hollywood in the 1930s. The ending has a few surprises, lots of action, and a tying together of loose ends. Goulart's best effort is in the characterization of Groucho, emphasizing his keen wit and rapid, often one-line, responses. Some of the funniest lines are those retorts he makes to people on the street who have recognized him. For those who enjoy the Marx Brothers movies, this is another chance to experience the same type of word play. For those young people who may not know of Groucho and his brothers, this title will serve as an introduction and may spur them on to find out more. Readers who are familiar with the 1930s-type mystery series, such as those by Stuart Kaminsky featuring Toby Peters, will find this novel particularly appealing.<br><i>Pam Johnson, Fairfax County Public Library, VA</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Irish Seaweed Kitchen: The Comprehensive Guide to Healthy Everyday Cooking with Seaweeds</h2><p>Irish seaboard lore, recipes old and new, nutritional information and personal anecdote combine with the faintest hint of nostalgia in this refreshingly original mix of common sense and practical cookery.

Believe it or not we also experimented with feeding it to pigs they loved it. However, in my 40 years on the island we never used seaweed in the kitchen. This wonderful book, with its many recipes shows what we have missed. </p> <p> The author is a medical doctor who has been harvesting and cooking seaweed, and gardening organically, since childhood. She begins the book with a quick guide to the health benefits and culinary uses of seaweed and then goes on to show how to prepare the various species. </p> <p> In the first chapter Stock and Soups, she gives a basic sea and land vegetable stock which can be used for any recipe requiring vegetable stock in the book. The chapter also features delicious-sounding recipes, from nettle soup with Alaria seaweed , to roasted red pepper and red lentil soup to herb and vegetable broth with Duileasc and cheese . </p> <p> The chapter on Starters and Light Lunches, includes Memories of Sleabhac , the author s wonderful childhood memories of harvesting this seaweed. Sleabhac is described as the perfect boost to the system and a great way to help the body fight off infection during the winter months. </p> <p> In the chapter Salad and Vegetables, the recipes beetroot and sea lettuce salad and popeye s gratin highlight Sea Lettuce (Ulva lactuca), 100g of which can provide up to 35% of vitamin B12 for adults. What about a basic seaweed smoothie, with Alaria, banana, pineapple and honey to give a great green boost in one glass. </p> <p> Other chapters show that seaweed can be used in many other fascinating recipes including breads, cakes, desserts and puddings. </p> <p> If you are unfamiliar with the names of the various seaweeds you can eat, the final chapter edible seaweeds has wonderful photographs of the various species, as well as details about where and when you can find them. </p> <p> The author also provides nutritional charts/range of values of each seaweed. </p> <p> Being a medical doctor, the author gives sound advice that the book is not intended to substitute any treatment or advice given by your medical practitioner.

His <b>Conversations with God</b> series, book 1, book 2, and book 3, have all been <b>New York Times</b> bestsellers--book 1 for over two years. The essence of Neale Donald Walsch's message lies at the heart of faith--the sacred place in every person, where he stands alone with his God. Walsch urges each of us to forge our own unique relationship with God, a God who is everywhere and speaks to us in all we do. It is up to us to stop and listen. It is up to us to respond . . . to begin the conversation. And a conversation is the first step, just as in any relationship, in establishing trust, in building friendship, in creating communion. In <b>Friendship with God</b>, Neale Donald Walsch shares the next part of his journey, and leads us to deepen and strengthen our own bonds with God. He honors our heart's desire: a closer connection, richer and fuller. A friendship with God.</p><p>Neale Donald Walsch grew up fearing God, especially after his mother, a neighborhood mystic, was caught reading cards for a friend. His mother was "trafficking with the devil," according to Walsch's deeply religious aunt, and as a result, "God will send her straight to hell."<p> That was the start of a relationship born of "fearship," as Walsch calls it. In <i>Friendship with God</i>, Walsh speaks to the struggles he's had learning to see God as a true friend rather than a punishing judge. Like his immensely popular <i>Conversations with God</i> series, <i>Friendship with God</i> is written mostly in dialogue format, modeling how anyone can converse with God. What makes the book especially accessible is Walsh's humble voice that gently addresses most people's confusion and doubts. For example, Walsh talks about feeling squeamish that God knows the shameful secrets of his life. In response, God points out that Walsh has shared his dark secrets with friends and lovers. So why not share these truths with God, who has never judged or punished him, and never will? These types of tender and reassuring conversations give readers the courage to begin their own private dialogues with the divine. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>The first book in a new series by the multimillion-copy bestselling author of <i>Conversations with God</i>.<br><br>Neale Donald Walsch has changed the way millions of Americans think about God.

In forty-six hours of interviews with Butterfield, supported by thousands of documents, many of them original and not in the presidential archives and libraries, Woodward has uncovered new dimensions of Nixon&#x2019;s secrets, obsessions and deceptions.<br> <br> <i>The Last of the President&#x2019;s Men</i> could not be more timely and relevant as voters question how much do we know about those who are now seeking the presidency in 2016&#x2014;what really drives them, how do they really make decisions, who do they surround themselves with, and what are their true political and personal values?</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of October 2015:</strong> Watergate junkies may think they know all there is to know about Richard Nixon and the inner circle behind Watergate and its aftermath, but journalist Bob Woodward &#x2013; one half of the team that made that whole sorry business public in the first place &#x2013; has one more Watergate card to play: <em>The Last of the President&#x2019;s Men</em> is a short and riveting look into the files and memory of Alexander Butterfield, who was Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman&#x2019;s deputy during that time. Probably best known to political junkies as the one who revealed that Nixon taped all conversations in the Oval Office, here Butterfield gives Woodward access to files and photos even the seasoned journalist had never seen before; while the resulting book doesn&#x2019;t necessarily tell us anything we didn&#x2019;t know about the foul mouthed, paranoid 37th president, it recalls his behavior with such specificity you can&#x2019;t help but be upset all over again. This is more engaging, in its disturbing way (Nixon&#x2019;s vulgarities and general ugliness of manner somehow shocked this usually unshockable reader), than the more wonky of Woodward&#x2019;s recent tomes &#x2013; and it&#x2019;s plenty enlightening about an era we thought we already knew. <em>&#x2013; Sara Nelson</em></p>Bob Woodward is an associate editor at <i>The Washington Post</i>, where he has worked for forty-seven years.

The tension between Tilla&#x2019;s rebellious nature and the ideal of a &#x2018;Good Roman Wife,&#x2019; and the tension between Ruso&#x2019;s outer gruffness and inner integrity make this Medicus installment much more than a mystery novel." - <i>Historical Novel Society</i></p><p>"Ruth Downie's books about second-century AD Roman Army doctor Ruso and his British wife Tilla, herself a healer and midwife, are among my favourite of all historical crime series.

A country in transition was also in transit. Everyone seemed en route: emigrating and immigrating, removing or being removed, resettling and relocating, in many directions--east to west, south to north, rural to urban, urban to suburban. In American slang, "going places" came to mean a geographic as well as a social destination. Movement so touched this American era that it deserves to be treated first in any survey of its everyday life. </p><p>An overseas diaspora marked the personal history of a quarter of Americans living in 1915. These "new" immigrants figure prominently in the national image of the period, an age of unprecedented immigration and one immortalized in two national symbols: the Statue of Liberty (1886) and Ellis Island (1892). Immigration entailed both departure and destination. The rupture of traditional everyday life--relocation from familiar surroundings, separation from kinfolk, the experience of becoming a foreigner and ceasing to belong--took a toll that will never be completely knowable. </p><p>America also experienced continual internal migration, causing Norwegian novelist, Knut Hamsun, to note, "Everyday is moving day . . . The population is only half-settled."1 Treks westward took every conceivable form: Arizona land runs, Yukon gold rushes, California dreams. Flights out of the South took blacks to northern cities and whites to the Southwest plains. Midwesterners, in a revolt from the village, poured into Milwaukee and Minneapolis, Cleveland and Chicago. </p><p>Movement increased on the margin as well as in the mainstream. Vagrants, squatters, and regiments of unemployed workers, took to the roads; some (for instance, Coxey's Army in 1893-94) marched on Washington (figure 1.9) to dramatize their plight. Paradoxically, as homeless, landless, and jobless Americans roamed city streets in the 1890s, other citizens took to traveling about on annual vacations. </p><p>Some Americans were moved against their will or prevented from moving. American Indian nations were systematically removed to (usually western) reservations. Nativists, a half million strong in the American Protective Association in 1894, clamored that some foreigners ought to be excluded or restricted in their movements, particularly if they were Orientals, Jews, or Catholics. Jim Crow laws sought to keep blacks in their place.</p><br> <p><i>Immigrants and Emigrants</i></p><br><p><b>Arrivals: Europe, Asia, and the Americas</b></p><p>Immigration officials, nativists, and social reformers often turned to statistics to demonstrate the massive influx of newcomers. For example, the U.S. Department of Labor mounted an "electrical diagram" at the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition that furnished spectators with extensive data on the "races of alien arrivals; occupations of those persons admitted; causes of exclusion; and arrests and deportations by classes."2 The display noted that before the Civil War, the banner year for new immigrants was 1854, when 427,833 people arrived. A new peak was reached in 1882, when 788,992 entered. However, in the early twentieth century the annual influx passed the million mark six times, and in 1907 the figure rose to 1,285,349.</p><p>Many who came after the 1880s were labeled "new immigrants" because they differed from those who previously emigrated largely from northern and western Europe. The outflow of Italians, Greeks, Slovaks, Poles, Russians, Austro-Hungarians, as well as people from the Orient (first the Chinese, then the Japanese and the Filipinos) and from Mexico diversified everyday American life. These new immigrants differed in religious background, for many were Greek Orthodox, Buddhist, or Roman Catholic, entering a basically Protestant society; a large segment were Russian and Polish Jews. The new immigrants spoke numerous languages and were generally poorer and less educated and more differentiated in color and culture than were the earlier immigrants. </p><p>In focusing only upon national statistics and ethnic diversity, historians often lose sight of emigrating and immigrating as personal historical acts. Why did individuals or families decide to go or to stay? How did they journey? Did they feel uprooted or transplanted? How did their everyday lives change? </p><p>In summarizing the European experience, John Bodnar suggests a combination of factors that prompted people to leave: the commercialization of agriculture, the decline of craft work, changes in landownership patterns, expansion of the population, and major shifts in the financial and market conditions of capitalism. To be sure, the familiar imponderables--wanderlust, adventure, family problems--played their part, but most of those who moved did so because they were "pragmatically adjusting their goals and behavior throughout the nineteenth century to meet the changing economic realities in Europe as well as opportunities in America." </p><p>Most emigrant streams Bodnar identifies followed one of two courses. Skilled artisans and independent farmers, threatened by the factory production of cheap goods and by the commercialization of agriculture, left first. Hoping to avoid the "further decline in social and economic status, they usually possessed modest financial resources, left in family units, and were less likely to return." As a pioneer wave, they "exercised leadership and influence in American ethnic communities." A second group, larger in size and poorer in status, "consisted of marginal land owners who hoped to earn enough to return and increase their holdings," the children of such owners, and those with no real property. This second group was comprised more of individuals than of family groupings and, at least initially, their intent often was to come to America to earn money that would allow them to improve their life once they returned to Europe. Whatever their plans, most immigrants set out well prepared for their journeys. Through kinship networks, labor agents, and other intermediaries, as well as emigrants' guides and maps, most had amassed a wealth of detailed information, before departing, concerning exactly where they wanted to go and how to get there.3 </p><p>Emigrants first journeyed to a major seaport, such as Liverpool, Hamburg, Le Havre, Bremen, or Antwerp. Once they were there, numerous decisions had to be made: which baggage runners, boardinghouse keepers, and provisioners to trust; which border officials, emigration officers, and government bureaucrats to placate; and which tickets, sailing routes, and accommodations to purchase.</p>From Schlereth (American Studies/Notre Dame): a detailed, lively survey of the commonplace objects, events, experiences, products, and tastes that comprised America's Victorian culture, expressed its values, and shaped modern life. Between the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 and the San Francisco one in 1915, the US population doubled, redistributed itself, and developed the character and lifestyle identified with the middle classes in the 20th century. Its mobility required roads, trains, trolleys, maps, canals, autos; new means of communication in telephones, telegraphs, and mass media; and a standard time devised by railroads and measured by alarm clocks, time clocks, and cheap watches. New economic systems emerged: farms were commercialized; foods were processed (Kellogg's), condensed (Borden's), preserved (Heinz), distributed in food chains (A&amp;P), promoted through advertising, and identified with brand names and slogans. New occupations emerged; typewriters created secretaries who cultivated new standards of personal appearance wearing shirtwaists, using cosmetics, shopping in department stores, and visiting beauty parlors. Toothpaste, razor blades, health foods, and spas expressed the rising interest in personal fitness as well as recreation, which extended to moving pictures, spectator sports, public gardens, amusement parks, and bicycles--all based on the new technologies, on the new vision of people mastering nature. But the book is not all trivia, not just the Juicy Fruit gum and the cafeteria-eating that Americans discovered at the San Francisco Fair. Schlereth, a writer of immense tact and range, recounts with equal interest and vitality the whole constellation of events that surrounded the development of suburban living, domestic history, the labor movement, the architecture of colleges--and conveys it seamlessly. The notes reveal something of his erudition, his ability to see the relationships, to depict unpretentiously this complex period of cultural history with all its ironies and color. A splendid achievement. (Forty-three pages of photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He is already the author of two books on the topic, and he edited the National Council of Teachers of English <i>Quarterly Review of Doublespeak</i> for 14 years. This year he was contracted by the Securities and Exchange Commission to write instructions on writing stock prospectuses in "plain" English. The resulting booklet is 58 pages. <i>Doublespeak Defined</i>, though, is essentially a thesaurus. Under 14 categories, such as education, the workplace, job titles, and sex and sexes, Lutz lists terms and their doublespeak counterparts. Included are sidebar press reports documenting doublespeak's pervasive reach, and cartoons lampooning its effects. Some examples are amusing and some are silly. Many, though, raise real concerns about the potential dangers of irresponsible and misleading language. <i>David Rouse</i></p><h2>Guns of Providence: Faith &amp; Freedom, Book 3 (Faith &amp; Freedom Trilogy)</h2><p>The American Revolution ignites a fire that rallies patriots to fight!

But the idea that the earth has a hollow interior was first proposed as a scientific theory in 1691 by Sir Edmond Halley (of comet fame), who also suggested that there might be life down there as well. <i>Hollow Earth</i> traces the many surprising, marvelous, and just plain weird permutations his ideas have taken over the centuries. Both Edgar Allan Poe and (more famously) Jules Verne picked up the torch in the nineteenth century, the latter with his science fiction epic <i>A Journey to the Center of the Earth</i>. The notion of a hollow earth even inspired a religion at the turn of the twentieth century-Koreshanity, which held not only that the earth was hollow, but also that we're all living on the <i>inside</i>. Utopian novels and adventures abounded at this same time, including L. Frank Baum's hollow earth addition to the Oz series and Edgar Rice Burroughs's <i>Pellucidar</i> books chronicling a stone-age hollow earth. In the 1940s an enterprising science-fiction magazine editor convinced people that the true origins of flying saucers lay within the hollow earth, relics of an advanced alien civilization. And there are still devout hollow earthers today, some of whom claim there is a New Age utopia lurking beneath the earth's surface, with at least one entrance near Mt. Shasta in California. <i>Hollow Earth</i> travels through centuries and cultures, exploring how each era's relationship to the idea of a hollow earth mirrored its hopes, fears, and values. Illustrated with everything from seventeenth-century maps to 1950s pulp art to movie posters and more, <i>Hollow Earth</i> is for anyone interested in the history of strange ideas that just won't go away.</p><p><b>David Standish</b> is the author of <i>The Art of Money</i> and has written for <i>Smithsonian</i>, <i>Audubon</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Outside</i>, <i>Travel &amp; Leisure</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, and <i>Chicago</i> magazine.

Starring Professor Gideon Oliver? ?a likable, down-to-earth, cerebral sleuth.? (CHICAGO TRIBUNE) </b><br><br>Sailing the Amazon with a group of botanists, ?Skeleton Detective? Gideon Oliver is on his dream vacation. But it turns nightmarish when fierce head-hunters narrowly miss killing the group leader, then a deranged passenger kills a botanist and flees. Long-past enmities and resentments?and new ones as well?might explain things. And when a fresh skeleton turns up in the river, Gideon is sure that, in this jungle full of predators, humans may be the deadliest of all.</p><p>Aaron Elkins is the author of the Edgar Award-winning Gideon Oliver mysteries.Elkins, who has won the Edgar Award for his Gideon Oliver series, trots out forensic anthropology professor Oliver for another adventure, this time along the Amazon River. Elkins totally avoids the sin of sloth represented by some mystery writers who habitually underresearch their topics. Elkins always presents a rich buffet of fascinating scientific facts, and this time his table overflows with information about the Amazon's wildlife and, even more intriguingly, its plant life, long used by natives as medicine and now studied by medical ethnobotanists. Elkins, generous with background, is a bit too generous with setup: by the time Professor Oliver and the research botanists actually get to the Amazon, readers may be tired of the overly long, and-then-there-were-none-style introductions to each character. Once underway on the Amazon, however, things quickly pick up, as a shrunken head, carried by a spear, lands on deck, and Oliver's detective skills are called into play when one of the botanists is murdered.

Epstein examines key decisions to demonstrate how Progressives attacked much of the legal precedent and eventually weakened the Court&#39;s thinking concerning limited federal powers and the protection of individual rights. Progressives on the Court undermined basic economic principles of freedom and competition, paving the way for the modern redistributive and regulatory state. As Epstein writes, the Progressives, were determined that their vision of the managed economy should take precedent in all areas of life. Although they purported to have great sophistication on economic and social matters, their understanding was primitive. The Progressives and their modern defenders have to live with the stark truth that the noblest innovations of the Progressive Era were its greatest failures. How Progressives Rewrote the Constitution shows that our modern constitutional law, fashioned largely by the New Deal Court in the late 1930s, has its roots in Progressivism, not in our country&#39;s founding principles, and how so many of those ideas, however discredited by more recent economic thought, still shape the Court&#39;s decisions.</p><p>"Epstein is one of America's most brilliant scholars. In this little book, he is at the top of his form." <br>--Alan Bock, The Orange County Register <p>"Epstein provides an astonishingly detailed account of the reformation of the US Constitution in surprisingly few pages. He highlights every major court case that altered the original ideals of the Constitution ever so slightly, but that turned out in the end to land America drastically far from the sound political ideals with which it had begun. Using intricate logic he lays out a strong argument against the Progressives and an equally strong argument for the Old Court.

Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia.<br><br>There were framed black-and-white photographs of Texas Rangers on the walls of the San Antonio Texas Ranger office. Like sepia ghosts of times gone by, they watched over the modern complex of telephones and fax machines and computers. Phones were ringing. Employees at desks were interviewing people. The hum of working machines settled over the office, oddly comforting, like an electrical lullaby.<br><br>Sergeant Marc Brannon was sitting kicked back in his swivel chair, his wavy blond-streaked brown hair shimmering under the ceiling lights as he pondered a stack of files on his cluttered desk. His narrow, pale gray eyes were almost closed as he thought about a disturbing recent mishap.<br><br>A close friend and fellow Texas Ranger, Judd Dunn, had been almost run over by a speeding car a few weeks earlier during a temporary assignment to the San Antonio office. There were rumors that it had something to do with a criminal investigation into illegal gambling that the FBI was conducting on local mob boss Jake Marsh in San Antonio. Dunn had been working with the FBI on the case, but shortly thereafter, Dunn had transferred down to the Victoria office, citing personal problems. Brannon had inherited the Marsh investigation. The FBI was also involved&#x2014;rather, an agent Brannon knew was involved; a Georgia-born nuisance named Curtis Russell. It was curious that Russell should be working on an FBI case. He'd been with the Secret Service. Of course, Marc reminded himself, men changed jobs all the time. He certainly had.<br><br>Apparently, Russell was knee-deep in the Marsh investigation. Attorney General Simon Hart had spoken with Brannon on the phone not two days ago, grumbling about Russell's tenacity. The former Secret Service agent was now in Austin giving the local officials fits while he dug into state crime lab computer files on two recent murders that he thought were tied to Marsh.<br><br>And who knew, maybe he was right. But pinning anything on the local mobster was going to take a miracle.<br><br>Marsh had his finger in all sorts of pies, including blackmail, prostitution and illegal betting, mostly in San Antonio, where he lived. If they could get something on him, they could invoke the state's nuisance abatement statute, which permitted any property to be closed down if it were used as a base of operations for criminals. Since Marsh was known to be involved in prostitution and illegal betting at his nightclub, all they had to do was prove it to oust him from the premises. Considering the real estate value of that downtown property, it would hit Marsh right where he lived. But knowing he was conducting illegal operations and proving it were two whole different kettles of fish. Marsh was an old hand at dodging investigators and searches. Doing things by the book sure seemed to give career criminals an advantage.<br><br>Pity that you couldn't just shoot the bad guys anymore, Brannon thought whimsically, eyeing a hundred-year-old framed photograph of a Texas Ranger on horseback with a lariat pulled tight around a dusty and wounded outlaw.<br><br>His lean hand went to the dark wood butt of the Colt .45 he wore in a holster on his hip. Since Rangers didn't have a specified uniform, they were allowed some personal choice in both dress and weaponry. But most of the men and women in the office wore white shirts and ties with their star-in-a-circle signature badge on the shirt. Most of them also wore white Stetsons and boots. To a Ranger, they were neat, conservative, polite and professional when they were on the job. Brannon tried very hard to adjust to that image. Well, he tried to, most of the time. He was more cautious about his job now than he ever had been before. He'd made the mistake of his life two years ago, misjudging a woman he'd grown to...care for, very much. His sister said that the woman didn't blame him for the mess he'd made of her life. But he blamed himself so much that he'd quit the Rangers and left Texas for two years to work with the FBI. But he'd learned that running from problems didn't solve them. They were portable. Like heartache.<br><br>He could still see her in his mind, blonde and sassy and full of dry wit. Despite the miseries of her life, she'd been the brightest, most delightful person he'd ever known. He missed her. She didn't miss him, of course. And why should she? He'd hurt her terribly. He'd ruined her life.<br><br>"Nothing to do, Brannon?" a female Ranger drawled as she passed him. All the women thought he was a dish, lean and slim-hipped, broad-chested, with that square sort of face that once graced cowboy movie posters. He had a sensuous mouth under a nose that had been broken at least once, and an arrogant sort of carriage that excited more than it intimidated. But he wasn't a rounder, by anybody's estimate. In fact, if he dated, he was so discreet that even the office gossip couldn't get anything on him.<br><br>"I am doing something," he drawled back with a twinkle in his eyes. "I'm using mental telepathy on escaped criminals. If I'm successful, they'll all be walking into law enforcement offices all over America as we speak, to turn themselves in."<br><br>"Pull the other one," she chuckled.<br><br>He sighed and smiled. "Okay. I just got back from testifying in a court case. I've got half a dozen cases to work and now I have to decide on priorities," he confessed. He flicked a long finger at the file stack. "I thought I might flip a coin..."<br><br>"No need. The captain has something urgent for you to do."<br><br>"Saved by new orders!" he joked. He jerked forward and his booted feet slammed to the floor. He got up and stretched enormously, pulling his white shirt with the silver Ranger badge on the pocket tight over hair-roughened, hard chest muscles. "What's the assignment?"<br><br>She tossed a sheet on his desk. "A homicide, in an alley off Castillo Boulevard," she told him. "White guy, mid-to-late-twenties. Two detectives from CID and a medical examiner investigator are already on scene, along with a couple of EMTs and patrol officers. The captain said you should go right now, before they call a contract ambulance to transport the dead body."<br><br>He scowled. "Hey, that's in the city limits. San Antonio PD has jurisdiction." he began.<br><br>"I know. But this one's tricky. They found a young white guy with a single gunshot wound to the back of the head, execution-style. Remember what's on Castillo Boulevard?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>She gave him a smug look. "Jake Marsh's nightclub. And the body was found in an alley two doors down from it."<br><br>He broke into a smile. "Well, well! What a nice surprise to drop in my lap, and just when I was feeling sorry for myself." He hesitated. "Wait a minute. Why's the captain giving it to me?" he asked suspiciously, glaring toward the head Ranger's closed door nearby. "The last assignment he gave me was looking into the mysterious death of a mutilated cow." He leaned down, because he was a head taller than she was. "They thought it was <em>aliens"</em> he whispered fervently.<br><br>She made a face. "You never know. Maybe it was!"<br><br>He glared at her.<br><br>She grinned. "He's just ticked because you got to work with the FBI for two years, and they turned down two applications from him. But he said you could have this murder case because you haven't embarrassed him this month. Yet."<br><br>"It won't be uncomplicated. In fact, I'll bet a week's pay that by dark it's going to turn into a media feeding frenzy," he said.<br><br>"I won't take that bet. And, by the way, he said you should stop getting gas at that new all-female gas station downtown, because it's giving the department a bad name."<br><br>He lifted both eyebrows. "What's he got against women pumping gas?" he asked innocently.<br><br>"Gas isn't all they're pumping." She flushed when she realized what she'd said, gestured impotently at the assignment sheet and exited in a flaming rush.<br><br>Brannon grinned wickedly as she retreated. He picked up the sheet and went out of the office, grabbing up his off-white Stetson on the way.<br>In Austin, a slender woman with her long blond hair in a bun, wearing big gold-rimmed glasses over her twinkling dark brown eyes, was trying to console one of the state attorney general's computer experts.<br><br>"He really likes you, Phil," Josette Langley told the young man, who was in the first month of his first job out of college. He looked devastated. "Honest he does."<br><br>Phil, redheaded and blue-eyed, glanced toward the door of Simon Hart, Texas Attorney General, and flushed even redder. "He said it was my fault his computer locked down while he was talking to the vice president online about an upcoming governors' conference. He got knocked off the network and couldn't get back on. He threw the mouse at me."<br><br>"Lucky you, that it wasn't attached to the CPU at the time," she said with a wicked grin. "Anyway, he only throws things when Tira's mad at him. It doesn't last long. Besides, the vice president is his third cousin," she pointed out. "And mine, too, come to think of it," she added thoughtfully. "Never mind, Phil, you have to learn to just let it wash over you, like water on a duck's back. Simon's quick-tempered, but he gets over it just as fast."<br><br>He gave her a baleful look. "He never yells at you."<br><br>"I'm a woman," she pointed out. "He's very old-fashioned about yelling at women. He and his brothers were raised strictly. They don't move with the times."<br><br>"He's got four brothers and he says they're all just like him. Imagine that!" he said.<br><br>She remembered that Phil was an only child, like herself. "They're not just like him. Anyway, they live in Jacobsville, Texas. The married ones are a lot calmer now." She didn't dare allow herself to think about the two remaining Hart bachelors, Leo and Rey. The stories about their homemade biscuit-craving and the things they did to satisfy it was becoming legendary.<br><br>"The bachelor ones aren't calm. One of them carried a cook out of a Victoria restaurant kicking and screaming last week, and they sent the Texas Rangers after him!"<br><br>"They sent Judd Dunn," she replied. "He's our cousin, too. But it was a joke, sort of. And she wasn't exactly screaming...Well, never mind. It's not important." She was talking too fast. She felt her face go hot at the mention of the Texas Rangers.<br><br>She had painful memories of one particular Texas Ranger, whom she'd loved passionately. Gretchen, Marc Brannon's sister, had told her that Marc Brannon had gone on a drunken rampage two years ago, just after they broke up and ended up on opposite sides of the courtroom in a high-profile murder trial. Marc had left the Rangers shortly afterward and enlisted with the FBI. He was back in San Antonio now, back with the Rangers again. Gretchen also said that Marc had almost driven himself crazy with guilt over an even older incident when Josette was fifteen and he was a policeman in Jacobsville. Odd, she thought, remembering the painful things he'd said to her when they broke up.<br><br>Josette had told Gretchen that she didn't blame Marc for his lack of belief in her innocence. Part of her didn't. Another, darker part wanted to hang him by his spurs from a live oak tree for the misery of the past two years. He'd never really believed her story until their last disastrous date, and he'd walked out on her without another word, after making her feel like a prostitute. She'd loved him. But he couldn't have loved her. If he had, he'd never have left Texas, not even if the murder trial had set them at odds.<br><br>She cleared her throat at the erotic images that flashed through her mind of her last date with Marc and turned her attention back to poor, downcast Phil Douglas.<br><br>"I'll square things with Simon for you," she promised him.<br><br></p><h2>Twenty-Six Seconds: A Personal History of the Zapruder Film</h2><p><strong>The moving, untold family story behind Abraham Zapruder's film footage of the Kennedy assassination and its lasting impact on our world. </strong><br><br>Abraham Zapruder didn't know when he ran home to grab his video camera on November 22, 1963 that this single spontaneous decision would change his family's life for generations to come. Originally intended as a home movie of President Kennedy's motorcade, Zapruder's film of the JFK assassination is now shown in every American history class, included in Jeopardy and Trivial Pursuit questions, and referenced in novels and films. It is the most famous example of citizen journalism, a precursor to the iconic images of our time, such as the Challenger explosion, the Rodney King beating, and the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers. But few know the complicated legacy of the film itself. <br><br>Now Abraham's granddaughter, Alexandra Zapruder, is ready to tell the complete story for the first time. With the help of the Zapruder family's exclusive records, memories, and documents, Zapruder tracks the film's torturous journey through history, all while American society undergoes its own transformation, and a new media-driven consumer culture challenges traditional ideas of privacy, ownership, journalism, and knowledge. <br><br>Part biography, part family history, and part historical narrative, Zapruder demonstrates how one man's unwitting moment in the spotlight shifted the way politics, culture, and media intersect, bringing about the larger social questions that define our age.</p><p>Alexandra Zapruder began her career on the founding staff of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. A graduate of Smith College, she later earned her Master's Degree in Education at Harvard University. She is the author of <i>Salvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust</i>, which won the National Jewish Book Award in the Holocaust category. She also served as the guest curator for an exhibition of original diaries at Holocaust Museum Houston. She wrote and co-produced <i>I'm Still Here</i>, a documentary film for young audiences based on <i>Salvaged Pages</i>, which was awarded the Jewish Image Award for Best Television Special by the National Foundation for Jewish Culture and was nominated for two Emmy awards. Alexandra has traveled around the country and spoken to thousands of teachers, students, and others about her work."A fascinating and cautionary tale."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Wall Street Journal</em></i></b><br><br>"Zapruder is a gifted writer and storyteller who delicately unravels a minor mystery few people know or care about, but that she makes human, complex and quite interesting."&#x2015;<b><i><em>New York Times Book Review</em></i></b><br><br>"Making use of family and government archives, interviews, and her own memory, Alexandra offers a supple, tender portrait of a family lashed to history."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Boston Globe</em></i></b><br><br>"The fifty year saga of the most important witness to the JFK assassination-a home movie shot by Abraham Zapruder-is a high-stakes morality tale, suspenseful, thought-provoking, and at times nasty.

The king&#x2019;s shy nature was offset by Churchill&#x2019;s willingness to cast himself as the nation&#x2019;s savior. Meanwhile, Churchill&#x2019;s complicated political past was given credibility by the king&#x2019;s embrace and counsel. Together as foils, confidants, conspirators, and comrades, the duo guided Britain through war while reinspiring hope in the monarchy, Parliament, and the nation itself.<br><br>Books about these men as individuals could fill a library, but Kenneth Weisbrode&#x2019;s study of the unique bond between them is the first of its kind.</p><p>Kenneth Weisbrode is a writer and historian living in Turkey.

On May 12, 1975, barely two weeks after U.S. helicopters lifted off the roof of the American embassy in Saigon, the S.S. Mayaguez was seized by Cambodian forces. Four days later, President Gerald Ford ordered a raid to free the ship, even though American diplomacy had already successfully negotiated its release. The U.S. Marine strike force took flight. The ensuing battle, the last of the war, took fourteen hours and the lives of forty-one Americans, including three soldiers who were unwittingly left behind when the U.S. choppers flew off. Vietnam veteran Ralph Wetterhahn has spent more than five years investigating what happened that day in the Cambodian jungle: how the abandonment of the three men who guarded the flank of the vulnerable Marine position occurred; why they were left to their tragic fate; and how -- from unprecedented interviews with the Khmer Rouge captors -- they met their grisly deaths. His spellbinding account redeems to our national memory these three entirely forgotten young Marines and their brave deeds under fire.<br></p><p>THE LAST BATTLE: THE MAYGUEZ INCIDENT AND THE END OF THE VIETNAM WAR has been named the recipient of the 2002 Colby Award. The Colby Award, named in honor of former C.I.A. Director William E. Colby, recognizes a book &#34;that has made a significant contribution to the public&#39;s understanding of intelligence operations, military history or international affairs.&#34;"Ralph Wetterhahn has the eye of an historian and the doggedness of the finest reporters. The author, who has spent years putting together the pieces of this hidden tale, grittily digs out the details of the fierce air, sea and ground battle, paints telling portraits of the three abandoned marines by going back to their hometowns and even tracks down the Khmer Rouge commander who ordered their executions. His book, written with a remarkably even hand, is in many ways a template for much of the Indochina conflict--secrets kept from the public, men taken prisoner and neither recovered nor honored, a government too often dedicated to face-saving and image. Not until the very end of the 1990s did the Pentagon finally provide some of the truth about the fate of the three marines. One has to think that Wetterhahn's in-the-works book had something to do with that brief burst of candor." <br>--Sydney Schanberg, Pulitzer-prize winning journalist and author of <i>The Death and Life of Dith Pran</i>, basis of the Oscar-winning film "The Killing Fields" <p></p><p>"Like the Vietnam War, the Mayaguez Incident is often recalled only for its mistakes and not for the lessons of duty and honor exemplified in the conduct of the men who fought it. This gripping account of the battle for Koh Tang, and the unwitting abandonment of three American marines on her shores, redeems the glory of all who fought to free the captured crew of the Mayaguez -- and resolves the fate of the men we left behind. As Wetterhahn shows, in the fog of a hard battle gone wrong, they held high a lantern of courage and faith that illuminated the way home with honor." <br>--Senator John McCain, author of <i>Faith of My Fathers</i> </p><p></p><p>"An absorbing story of incredible bravery and sacrifice by marines, airmen, and sailors in battle, and a depressing account of leadership failure from the White House down to senior commanders in the field. This is a cautionary tale about leaders who bring disaster when they micromanage military crises half a world away. It should be read by all Americans concerned about their nation's military forces." <br>--Bevin Alexander, author of <i>How Hitler Could Have Won WWII</i></p></p><h2>Diana Tregarde Investigates (Children of the Night, Burning Water, &amp; Jinx High)</h2><p>Long before Buffy showed the world how tough girls could be, Mercedes Lackey created Diana Tregarde. Diana is a Guardian charged with saving innocents and destroying evil wherever she finds it. Because if she doesn&#39;t, evil will find her-and kill her first. In Children of the Night, Diana is running her friend&#39;s occult shop in New York City when trouble does finds her. Mr. Trouble, as she calls him, is a vampire whose psychic power makes her radar go off the charts. So when she discovers that he&#39;s the new benefactor of ex-boyfriend Dave Kendall&#39;s band, she&#39;s not surprised to see how bad Kendall looks. It will take all of Diana&#39;s power-and the aid of a sexy vampire protector with a score of his own to settle-if she&#39;s to save Kendall now.... In Burning Water, Diana gets a call from Detective Mark Valdez, an old college friend turned cop. When Valdez realizes that the serial killer stalking Dallas is not human, he knows he needs help. Unfortunately, Tezcatilpoca, an angry Aztec god, is on the rampage and Diana fears she&#39;s met her match. But as luck would have it, Texcatilpoca isn&#39;t the only god in the world. In Jinx High, Diana is summoned to Oklahoma by an old friend who fears that his teenage son is in supernatural danger from a fellow classmate. Faye Harper, the &#34;it&#34; girl with a mean streak a mile wide, is actually a sorceress whose power is disturbing. So disturbing, in fact, that an ancient being who slumbers underground is being awakened by it...and all hell is about to break loose-literally. Jacket art by Chris McGrath.

The fire in the wood-burning stove in the corner crackled and danced, keeping the pub toasty and bathing everything in a warm light. Condensation froze against the glass windows in refined, complex patterns that blurred the view of the outside. Guests sat by threes and fours around low tables in g��pa, relaxed and convivial, enjoying small plates of roasted peanuts dipped in taro sauce that sharpened the taste of alcohol.<br> <br>Ordinarily, an entertainer in this venue could not expect a cessation in the constant murmur of conversation. But gradually, the buzzing of competing voices died out. For now, at least, there was no distinction between merchants&#x2019; stable boys from Wolf&#x2019;s Paw, scholars&#x2019; servant girls from Haan, low-level government clerks sneaking away from the office for the afternoon, laborers resting after a morning&#x2019;s honest work, shopkeepers taking a break while their spouses watched the store, maids and matrons out for errands and meeting friends&#x2014;all were just members of an audience enthralled by the storyteller standing at the center of the tavern.<br> <br>He took a sip of foamy beer, put the mug down, slapped his hands a few times against his long, draping sleeves, and continued:<br> <br>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Hegemon unsheathed Na-aro�nna then, and King Mocri stepped back to admire the great sword: the soul-taker, the head-remover, the hope-dasher. Even the moon seemed to lose her luster next to the pure glow of this weapon.<br> <br>&#x201c;That is a beautiful blade,&#x201d; said King Mocri, champion of Gan. &#x201c;It surpasses other swords as Consort Mira excels all other women.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Hegemon looked at Mocri contemptuously, his double-pupils glinting. &#x201c;Do you praise the weapon because you think I hold an unfair advantage? Come, let us switch swords, and I have no doubt I will still defeat you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; said Mocri. &#x201c;I praise the weapon because I believe you know a warrior by his weapon of choice. What is better in life than to meet an opponent truly worthy of your skill?&#x201d;<br> <br>The Hegemon&#x2019;s face softened. &#x201c;I wish you had not rebelled, Mocri.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>In a corner barely illuminated by the glow of the stove, two boys and a girl huddled around a table. Dressed in hempen robes and tunics that were plain but well-made, they appeared to be the children of farmers or perhaps the servants of a well-to-do merchant&#x2019;s family. The older boy was about twelve, fair-skinned and well proportioned. His eyes were gentle and his dark hair, naturally curly, was tied into a single messy bun at the top of his head. Across the table from him was a girl about a year younger, also fair-skinned and curly-haired&#x2014;though she wore her hair loose and let the strands cascade around her pretty, round face. The corners of her mouth were curled up in a slight smile as she scanned the room with lively eyes shaped like the body of the graceful dyran, taking in everything with avid interest. Next to her was a younger boy about nine, whose complexion was darker and whose hair was straight and black. The older children sat on either side of him, keeping him penned between the table and the wall. The mischievous glint in his roaming eyes and his constant fidgeting offered a hint as to why. The similarity in the shapes of their features suggested they were siblings.<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t this great?&#x201d; whispered the younger boy. &#x201c;I bet Master Ruthi still thinks we&#x2019;re imprisoned in our rooms, enduring our punishment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Phyro,&#x201d; said the older boy, a slight frown on his face, &#x201c;you know this is only a temporary reprieve. Tonight, we each still have to write three essays about how Kon Fiji&#x2019;s Morality applies to our misbehavior, how youthful energy must be tempered by education, and how&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shhhh&#x2014;&#x201d; the girl said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to hear the storyteller! Don&#x2019;t lecture, Timu. You already agreed that there&#x2019;s no difference between playing first and then studying, on the one hand, and studying first and then playing, on the other. It&#x2019;s called &#x2018;time-shifting.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m beginning to think that this &#x2018;time-shifting&#x2019; idea of yours would be better called &#x2018;time-wasting,&#x2019; &#x201d; said Timu, the older brother. &#x201c;You and Phyro were wrong to make jokes about Master Kon Fiji&#x2014;and I should have been more severe with you. You should accept your punishment gracefully.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, wait until you find out what Th�ra and I&#x2014;mmf&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl had clamped a hand over the younger boy&#x2019;s mouth. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not trouble Timu with too much knowledge, right?&#x201d; Phyro nodded, and Th�ra let go.<br> <br>The young boy wiped his mouth. &#x201c;Your hand is salty! Ptui!&#x201d; Then he turned back to Timu, his older brother. &#x201c;Since you&#x2019;re so eager to write the essays, Toto-tika, I&#x2019;m happy to yield my share to you so that you can write six instead of three. Your essays are much more to Master Ruthi&#x2019;s taste anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s ridiculous! The only reason I agreed to sneak away with you and Th�ra is because as the eldest, it&#x2019;s my responsibility to look after you, and you promised you would take your punishment later&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Elder Brother, I&#x2019;m shocked!&#x201d; Phyro put on a serious mien that looked like an exact copy of their strict tutor&#x2019;s when he was about to launch into a scolding lecture. &#x201c;Is it not written in Sage Kon Fiji&#x2019;s Tales of Filial Devotion that the younger brother should offer the choicest specimens in a basket of plums to the elder brother as a token of his respect? Is it also not written that an elder brother should try to protect the younger brother from difficult tasks beyond his ability, since it is the duty of the stronger to defend the weaker? The essays are uncrackable nuts to me, but juicy plums to you. I am trying to live as a good Moralist with my offer. I thought you&#x2019;d be pleased.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That is&#x2014;you cannot&#x2014;&#x201d; Timu was not as practiced at this particular subspecies of the art of debate as his younger brother. His face grew red, and he glared at Phyro. &#x201c;If only you would direct your cleverness to actual schoolwork.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You should be happy that Hudo-tika has done the assigned reading for once,&#x201d; said Th�ra, who had been trying to maintain a straight face as the brothers argued. &#x201c;Now please be quiet, both of you; I want to hear this.&#x201d;<br> <br>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;slammed Na-aro�nna down, and Mocri met it with his ironwood shield, reinforced with cruben scales. It was as if Fithow�o had clashed his spear against Mount Kiji, or if Kana had slammed her fiery fist against the surface of the sea. Better yet, let me chant for you a portrait of that fight:<br> <br>On this side, the champion of Gan, born and bred on Wolf&#x2019;s Paw;<br> <br>On that side, the Hegemon of Dara, last scion of Cocru&#x2019;s marshals.<br> <br>One is the pride of an island&#x2019;s spear-wielding multitudes;<br> <br>The other is Fithow�o, the God of War, incarnate.<br> <br>Will the Doubt-Ender end all doubt as to who is master of Dara?<br> <br>Or will Goremaw finally meet a blood-meal he cannot swallow?<br> <br>Sword is met with sword, cudgel with shield.<br> <br>The ground quakes as dual titans leap, smash, clash, and thump.<br> <br>For nine days and nine nights they fought on that desolate hill,<br> <br>And the gods of Dara gathered over the whale&#x2019;s way to judge the strength of their will.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>As he chanted, the storyteller banged a coconut husk against a large kitchen spoon to simulate the sounds of sword clanging against shield; he leapt about, whipping his long sleeves this way and that to conjure the martial dance of legendary heroes in the flickering firelight of the pub. As his voice rose and fell, urgent one moment, languorous the next, the audience was transported to another time and place.<br> <br>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;After nine days, both the Hegemon and King Mocri were exhausted. After parrying another strike from the Doubt-Ender, Mocri took a step back and stumbled over a rock. He fell, his shield and sword splayed out to the sides. With one more step, the Hegemon would be able to bash in his skull or lop off his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Phyro couldn&#x2019;t help himself. Timu and Th�ra, equally absorbed by the tale, didn&#x2019;t shush him.<br> <br>The storyteller nodded appreciatively at the children, and went on.<br> <br>But the Hegemon stayed where he was and waited until Mocri climbed back up, sword and shield at the ready.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you not end it just now?&#x201d; asked Mocri, his breathing labored.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because a great man deserves to not have his life end by chance,&#x201d; said the Hegemon, whose breathing was equally labored. &#x201c;The world may not be fair, but we must strive to make it so.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hegemon,&#x201d; said Mocri, &#x201c;I am both glad and sorry to have met you.&#x201d;<br> <br>And they rushed at each other again, with lumbering steps and proud hearts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now that is the manner of a real hero,&#x201d; whispered Phyro, his tone full of admiration and longing. &#x201c;Hey, Timu and Th�ra, you&#x2019;ve actually met the Hegemon, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but that was a long time ago,&#x201d; Timu whispered back. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really remember much except that he was really tall, and those strange eyes of his looked terribly fierce. I remember wondering how strong he must have been to be able to wield that huge sword on his back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He sounds like a great man,&#x201d; said Phyro. &#x201c;Such honor in every action; such grace to his foes. Too bad he and Da could not&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shhhh!&#x201d; Th�ra interrupted. &#x201c;Hudo-tika, not so loud! Do you want everyone here to know who we are?&#x201d;<br> <br>Phyro might be a rascal to his older brother, but he respected the authority of his older sister. He lowered his voice. &#x201c;Sorry. He just seems such a brave man. And Mocri, too. I&#x2019;ll have to tell Ada-tika all about this hero from her home island. How come Master Ruthi never taught us anything about Mocri?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is just a story,&#x201d; Th�ra said. &#x201c;Fighting nonstop for nine days and nine nights&#x2014;how can you believe that really happened? Think: The storyteller wasn&#x2019;t there, how would he know what the Hegemon and Mocri said?&#x201d; But seeing the disappointment on her little brother&#x2019;s face, she softened her tone. &#x201c;If you want to hear real stories about heroes, I&#x2019;ll tell you later about the time Auntie Soto stopped the Hegemon from hurting Mother and us. I was only three then, but I remember it as though it happened yesterday.&#x201d;<br> <br>Phyro&#x2019;s eyes brightened and he was about to ask for more, but a rough voice broke in.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had just about enough of this ridiculous tale, you insolent fraud!&#x201d;<br> <br>The storyteller stopped in midsentence, shocked at this intrusion into his performance. The tavern patrons turned to look at the speaker. Standing next to the stove, the man was tall, barrel-chested, and as muscular as a stevedore. He was easily the largest person in the pub. A jagged scar that started at his left brow and ended at his right cheek gave his face a fearsome aspect, which was only enhanced by the wolf&#x2019;s-teeth necklace that dangled in front of the thick chest hair that peeked out of the loose lapels of his short robe like a patch of fur. Indeed, the yellow teeth that showed between his sneering lips reminded one of a hungry wolf on the prowl.<br> <br>&#x201c;How dare you fabricate such stories about that crook Mata Zyndu? He tried to thwart Emperor Ragin&#x2019;s righteous march to the throne and caused much needless suffering and desolation. By praising the despicable tyrant Zyndu, you&#x2019;re denigrating the victory of our wise emperor and casting aspersions upon the character of the Dandelion Throne. These are words of treason.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Treason? For telling a few stories?&#x201d; The storyteller was so furious that he started to laugh. &#x201c;Will you next claim that all folk opera troupes are rebels for enacting the rise and fall of old Tiro dynasties? Or that the wise Emperor Ragin is jealous of shadow puppet plays about Emperor Mapid�r�? What a silly man you are!&#x201d;<br> <br>The owners of the Three-Legged Jug, a rotund man of short stature and his equally rotund wife, rushed up between the two to play peacemakers. &#x201c;Masters!

Alternative therapies might not seem aggressive enough as the patient wants the cancer gone, and fast. Integrative cancer care combines both options to bring the informed cancer patient the best of both worlds. Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful to enhance the effects of chemotherapy while at the same time experience fewer side effects? Or recover faster from radiation therapy or surgery? These options may now be available to you. Cancer patients are intelligent consumers who have access to a vast pool of information on the internet. They are asking questions and demanding answers. They want to understand ways to kill the cancer while keeping their own body alive and healthy. The oncologist specializes in killing the cancer, through surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. They are not trained in diets, supplements or integrative treatments that assist your body in fighting cancer. Naturopathic doctors are the specialists in this, particularly those whose focus is oncology. There are many therapies available that can minimize your side effects from traditional chemotherapy and radiation treatments while enhancing their effectiveness. Dr. Adam McLeod&#39;s new book, Integrative Cancer Care: The Power of Being Informed, is an easy to understand guide, which navigates the reader through the complex world of the molecular biology behind integrative cancer care. Combine the best of conventional cancer treatments with specific natural therapies. Say YES to both worlds! Understand how and why some therapies may be beneficial to you to maximize your outcome. This evidence-based practical book is completely referenced with scientific studies for the health care professional and the layperson alike. Become an informed patient and get involved in your own healing!

While there he encounters something that turns his whole life upside down. Each fact he uncovers only leads to more questions until finally a picture emerges which is more terrible than he could have ever imagined - a portrait of evil stretching across 60 years and thousands of lives into his own personal nightmares.</p><p>Gabriel Allon hasn't been back to Vienna since his wife and child died there in a terrorist bombing. But when his mentor in the Israeli intelligence agency dispatches him to the Austrian capitol to investigate a murderous explosion at the Wartime Claims and Inquiry Office, his presence alerts the attention of police officials who have reasons to stand in the way of his investigation. When a concentration camp survivor is killed who could link the father of Austria's next chancellor to Nazi atrocities and an ongoing coverup by the Catholic Church, Allon discovers another connection to the conspiracy, this one closer to his own past than he could ever have imagined. This is the third of Silva's thrillers featuring Allon, the art restorer who's also a spy (<i>The Confessor</i> and <i>The English Assassin</i> are the first two). In an endnote, the author calls them a "completed cycle dealing with the unfinished business of the Holocaust." Allon is such a compelling hero that one hopes Silva, a skilled craftsman and a terrific story-teller, will bring him back in another series. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Art restorer and sometime spy Gabriel Allon is sent to Vienna to authenticate a painting, but the real object of his search becomes something else entirely: to find out the truth about the photograph that has turned his world upside down. It is the face of the unnamed man who brutalized his mother in the last days of World War II, during the Death March from Auschwitz. But is it really the same one? If so, who is he? How did he escape punishment? Where is he now?<br><br>Fueled by an intensity he has not felt in years, Allon cautiously begins to investigate, but the more layers he strips away, the greater the evil that is revealed, a web stretching across sixty years and thousands of lives. Soon, the quest for one monster becomes the quest for many. And the monsters are stirring . . . <br><br>Filled with sharply etched characters and prose, and a plot of astonishing intricacy, this is an uncommonly intelligent thriller by one of our very best writers.<br><i>From the Compact Disc edition.</i></p><h2>Second Year Latin Workbook</h2><p>Book by Charles Jenney, Jr., David D.

He would live to regret it.<br><br> Once again Ace Atkins transforms real-life events into riveting, thrilling fiction. Infamous is a passionate blend of historical novel and crime story-set in the first days of the modern FBI, featuring an unexpected hero, some of the most colorful supporting characters in recent crime fiction, and the unforgettable Kathryn Kelly (George Kelly's wife), the Lady Macbeth of Depression-era crime.<br><br></p><p>Ace Atkins is the author of <i>White Shadow</i>, <i>Wicked City</i>, <i>Devil's Garden</i>, and four Nick Travers novels. He lives on a farm outside Oxford, Mississippi.In 1933 oil baron Charles Urschel was kidnapped by George &#34;Machine Gun&#34; Kelly and his wife, Kathryn, who was the far more evil one of the pair. Writer Ace Atkins fictionalizes that incident and turns out an interesting story of Depression-era violence and intrigue. Dick Hill narrates in his familiar laid-back country-boy style. It mostly fits, especially for the intrepid lawmen, but the pace feels a bit slow here and there. There are many bit players in the story, rounding it out in some respects. Perhaps the most fascinating part of the work is the author&#39;s characterization of Machine Gun Kelly as a man who kills simply out his desire to become famous--any way he can.

By gleaning every possible reference from history, literature, and popular lore, Sandburg successfully captures not only the legendary president, but also Lincoln the man.

I am a beginner at guitar and have found this book very good for getting me to grips with the chords. The book shows all chords from more than one position, which is great as there are a few ways to play each chord. The chord diagrams are very clear thus easy to understand. So much so, I also recommend this for the young beginner. It&#39;s good if you want to teach yourself or if you wish to use it to compliment professional lessons. Personally, I am teaching myself and have found that using this alongside the fantastic Garage band guitar tutorials is a great combination and I am learning very quickly too. It is quite a thick booklet but not a large book so won&#39;t take up too much room in a bag. As other reviewers have also mentioned...it is ring binded meaning it is easy to leave open to glance at whilst your hands are occupied with the guitar. I recommend this to anyone who plays or wants to play guitar. Amazon 5.0 out of 5 stars | Best chord book | By A.

Their meta-narrative, which traces the philosophical and psychic roots of contemporary civilization, weaves together a range of photographic source images, from St Peter&#39;s to Disneyland to Big Brother, that together tell the banal and terrifying story of our times. Luc Tuymans: Is It Safe? features this source imagery alongside more than 100 of the artist&#39;s newest paintings, many never before published. Accompanying each body of work is an introductory text written by the artist, while the essay &#39;Tuymans, Loyola, Leibniz&#39;, specially commissioned by Mexican artist Pablo Sigg, provides historical and philosophical context. &#39;Proper&#39;, an essay by Belgian art historian Gerrit Vermeiren, looks at one body of work in detail, tracing the themes and sources of each painting and capturing the cultural atmosphere of the moment in which they were produced. And an extensive interview between Tuymans and his assistant Tommy Simoens offers additional insight into the artist&#39;s thinking and motivations. Celebrated as one of the world&#39;s most gifted and visionary painters, Tuymans has been creating iconic works of contemporary painting for nearly three decades. With their enigmatic compositions and modulated colours, these works are moving and unmistakable, and their power continues to win new converts to Tuymans&#39;s chilling vision of history painting.</p><p>Luc Tuymans has been the subject of solo exhibitions at major museums around the world, including Tate Modern, the Wexner Center for the Arts and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. He lives in Antwerp. Pablo Sigg is an artist and writer based in Mexico City. Gerrit Vermeiren is an artist, art historian and writer based in Antwerp. His books include <i>Luc Tuymans: I Don't Get It</i>.&#34;Seasonal reading... Amongst other recently published monographs, the revised and enlarged edition of Phaidon&#39;s Luc Tuymans, from its Contemporary Artists Series is opportune as it is just in time for his major show at Tate Modern in the Summer of 2004. Indeed Tate will find it difficult to match the breadth and scale of this book in any exhibition catalogue it may choose to produce. Tuymans is rapidly gaining ground as the successor to Gerhard Richter as the History Painter of the late 20th Century, and this book, which amounts to a catalogue raisonne as nearly every one of his paintings is reproduced, goes some way towards confirming his reputation.&#34;-Art Monthly</p><h2>The Lord&#39;s Table: A Biblical Approach to Weight Loss (Setting Captives Free)</h2><p>Our culture today is rich in knowledge of how to lose weight, but bankrupt in applying that knowledge and getting free from overeating.

Apparently, the accidental killing of her world-class nuclear physicist husband by a wild bear was not an accident after all. The death was a set up and Maria knows who did it. The priest thinks she's having a senile fit, but she's serious. So serious, that uttering the dreaded words, "The Matarese ... the consummate evil" seems to vacuum the life right out of her.

After all, it was the women, the mothers, who got us all through the Ice Age. In the animal kingdom, the female is the most vicious in protecting her young." In other words, if a post Ice Age feminist read this book and ran into Ludlum, she probably wouldn't embrace him. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i>Following his successes with <i>The Apocalypse Watch</i> and the smashing return of the vintage Ludlum novel, <i>The Cry of the Halidon,</i> the unsurpassed master of the international superthriller, Robert Ludlum, has crafted another tale filled with suspense, deception, serpentine plot twists, and explosive revelations.<br></p><h2>Who Shot the Water Buffalo?: A Novel</h2><p>Lieutenant Tom Huckelbee, leathery as any Texican come crawling out of the sage, and Lieutenant Mike Cochran, loquacious son of an Ohio gangster, make an unlikely pair training to be Marine chopper pilots on their way to Vietnam.

Reader&#39;s Guide available. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>Like twins whose paths diverge dramatically, these two gentle stories share little beyond the mesmerizing voice of their creator. The surreal subject matter and dreamy narration of "Hardboiled" make it read rather like a bedtime story gone awry. When the young female narrator realizes that it's the anniversary of her lover's death, several curious events suddenly make sense: a stone from a creepy shrine that finds its way into her pocket; a fire at an udon shop where she'd just been eating; and a nighttime visitation by the ghost of a woman who committed suicide. "Harboiled" drags a bit, but "Hard Luck" is a pleasure, even if it's almost as downbeat as its predecessor. This time, a young female narrator is standing watch over her older sister, Kuni, whose brain is slowly dying after a cerebral hemorrhage. As their parents gradually lose hope for Kuni's recovery, the narrator makes her own peace by forging a bond with her sister's fianc�'s brother. In this gemlike story, Yoshimoto (<i>Goodbye Tsugumi</i>) takes a subtle, graceful look at the relationship between the sisters and the fault lines in this grieving family, elevating her little book from fine to downright moving. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.In her seventh book of spare, piercing fiction, Japanese writer Yoshimoto once again portrays strong-minded young women coping with heartbreak, traumatic family fissures, drastic illness, and fatalities. This sounds grim, but Yoshimoto is tenderly ironic and keenly attuned to nature's beauty and the mystic dimension of life, and her characters' ability to tough their way through painful predicaments infuses her elegantly insightful stories with hope. Here two novellas portray two self-possessed yet besieged young women. In "Hardboiled," the narrator is on a solo journey that begins as a simple mountain trek and turns into an intense confrontation with otherworldly forces, including a ghost in a hotel and overwhelming memories of a lost lover and her terrible demise. In "Hard Luck," a tale all the more poignant in the wake of Terry Shiavo, the narrator's sister lies in a coma as her family struggles to find a way to say good-bye. Yoshimoto writes of profoundly complex matters of love, life, decorum, guilt, and death with the precision and grace of a traditional calligrapher. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Eisenhower, revolutionized spying and warfare. In great secrecy and beyond the prying eyes of Congress and the press, they built exotic new machines that opened up the Soviet Union to surveillance and protected the United States from surprise nuclear attack. Secret Empire is the dramatic story of these men and their inventions, told in full for the first time. In a brief period of explosive, top-secret innovation during the 1950s, a small group of scientists, engineers, businessmen, and government officials rewrote the book on airplane design and led the nation into outer space. In an effort no less audacious than the creation of the atomic bomb, they designed, built, and operated the U-2 and supersonic SR-71 spy planes and Corona, the first reconnaissance satellites -- machines that could collect more information about the Soviet Union&#39;s weapons in a day than an army of spies could assemble in a decade. Their remarkable inventions and daring missions made possible arms control agreements with Moscow that helped keep the peace during the cold war, as well as the space-based reconnaissance, mapping, communications, and targeting systems used by America&#39;s armed forces in the Gulf War and most recently in Afghanistan. These hugely expensive machines also led to the neglect of more traditional means of intelligence gathering through human spies. Veteran New York Times reporter and editor Philip Taubman interviewed dozens of participants and mined thousands of previously classified documents to tell this hidden, far-reaching story. He reconstructs the crucial meetings, conversations, and decisions that inspired and guided the development of the spy plane and satellite projects during one of the most perilous periods in our history, a time when, as Eisenhower said, the world seemed to be &#34;racing toward catastrophe.&#34; Taubman follows this dramatic story from the White House to the CIA, from the Pentagon to Lockheed&#39;s Skunk Works in Burbank, from the secret U-2 test base in Nevada to the secret satellite assembly center in Palo Alto and other locations here and abroad. He reveals new information about the origins and evolution of the projects and how close they came to failing technically or falling victim to bureaucratic inertia and Washington&#39;s turf wars. The incredibly sophisticated spies in the skies were remarkably successful in proving that the missile gap was a myth in protecting us from surprise Soviet attack. But in some ways, the failure to detect the planning for the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, can also be attributed to these powerful machines as the government became increasingly dependent on spy satellites to the neglect of human agents and informants. Now, as we wage a new and more vicious war against terrorism, we will need both machines in space and spies on the ground to fight back.</p><p><b>Philip Taubman,</b> deputy editorial page editor of the <i>New York Times,</i> has reported on national security and intelligence issues for more than twenty years. The recipient of two Polk awards, he was the <i>Times's</i> Moscow bureau chief in the late 1980s and directed the Washington bureau's coverage of the Persian Gulf War. He lives in New York City.<p><b>Chapter One: "Racing Toward Catastrophe"</b> </p><p> Hal Austin had always assumed that the first time he flew an American warplane into Russian airspace, Moscow and Leningrad would be burning, incinerated by an American nuclear attack. This was no Strangelovian fantasy. It was his job description. </p><p> As a reconnaissance pilot in the Strategic Air Command (SAC), he had standing orders in the early 1950s to join the initial wave of American bombers over Moscow if the cold war turned hot. He would activate high-powered cameras to record the damage below. Every week, no matter where he was based, Austin would carefully review his role under the Emergency War Order, the top-secret plan for SAC operations in the opening hours of World War III. Though his day-to-day work was training other pilots in flight techniques, Austin knew his ultimate responsibility, however unthinkable it might seem, was to guide his aircraft through the nuclear firestorm to determine what was left of the targets around the Soviet capital that the bombers were supposed to destroy. </p><p> His assumptions were overturned on May 8, 1954. As first light faintly illuminated the rolling English countryside west of London that Saturday morning, Austin and his two-member crew were summoned to an unscheduled meeting at Fairford Royal Air Force Base, where they were temporarily stationed. The three men, dressed in their flight suits and anticipating another uneventful day of flying, were separated from the other American crews by their wing commander, Col. Joe Preston, and directed to a small, simply furnished conference room. There, two SAC colonels whom they had never seen before -- one an operations officer, the other an intelligence officer -- invited them to be seated, then gave them startling news. </p><p> That day, the airmen were told, they were to fly over the Soviet Union to photograph military airfields on Russia's northern frontier. They would be hundreds of miles from friendly airspace, under orders to maintain radio silence. If they were shot down, the U.S. government would disavow their mission and make no effort to rescue them. </p><p> Any doubt that they were about to venture along the most hazardous front lines of the cold war was eliminated when one of the colonels unfurled a long, narrow map and placed it on the table. It showed a corridor starting over the Barents Sea and running southeast from the Soviet port of Murmansk across the Kola Peninsula and White Sea to Arkhangel'sk. The remote Arctic area was studded with Soviet air and naval bases and air defense forces. </p><p> The three men, part of the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, stood up to get a closer look at the map. Nine airfields were marked along the flight plan. The two colonels did not explain why these bases had been selected for photographing, but Austin surmised that the war planners at SAC wanted fresh targeting information. As Vance Heavilin, the navigator for the flight, examined the thin strip of paper, he learned there was a reason for its diminutive dimensions. If the plane was forced down in Soviet territory, his duty was to crumple the map into a small ball and swallow it before the Americans were captured. </p><p> In the chilling, cold war calculus that prevailed at the time, the mission was a necessary intelligence-gathering task. The United States had to update its war plans frequently, and monitoring the picket line of airfields along the northwest Soviet border would show whether the Russians were gathering their forces for a surprise attack. Knowing what aircraft were in the area would also help SAC figure out how to suppress Soviet air defense units so American bombers could reach their assigned targets over the Russian heartland. Austin's high-flying RB-47E, a six-engine jet that could cruise above 40,000 feet at better than 600 mph, would be well above the range of the Soviet MiG-15 fighters that were thought to be based in the region. The crew was told that the most advanced Soviet fighter, the MiG-17, was still being tested and none of the new planes would likely be stationed along their route. The new fighter was designed to fly higher and faster than the MiG-15, and might be able to intercept the American plane. </p><p> In truth the flight plan was a high-risk gamble, a cold war roll of the dice that might well end up killing Austin and his crew or depositing them in a Siberian prison camp. Once the American plane crossed into Soviet airspace, there was no guarantee it would ever get out. There was even a chance that the flight could ignite a wider conflict with the Soviet Union. </p><p> Under international law and the rules of war, the planned violation of Soviet airspace would be an act of aggression, potentially reason enough for the Kremlin to retaliate by attacking the United States. President Dwight Eisenhower well understood the danger, and kept a tight rein on flights over Soviet territory, insisting that most missions be cleared in advance by him. Later in his presidency, he would tell the Pentagon's top civilian and military leaders that nothing would send him more quickly to Congress to request authority to declare war than the violation of American airspace by Soviet aircraft. </p><p> Harold R. Austin, a native of Sweetwater, Oklahoma, was twenty-nine years old, a quintessential SAC warrior immersed in the unforgiving business of preparing to wage nuclear war. Flying was his life and passion, and he was skilled at it. His commanders had placed him among the elite group of pilots selected to make sure other airmen met the SAC standards for handling of the RB-47E jets that had recently been acquired for reconnaissance work. </p><p> As Austin surveyed his aircraft on the morning of May 8, 1954, it seemed well suited to his daring mission. The streamlined plane with swept-back wings was equipped with six General Electric J47 engines, each capable of producing 7,200 pounds of thrust. With a maximum speed of 610 mph, a range of 3,500 miles, and a cruising ceiling above 40,000 feet, it was ideal for high-altitude, long-distance reconnaissance flights. </p><p> The reconnaissance model was built to carry cameras, not bombs. The bomb bay, which would normally hold one nuclear bomb, was instead configured to house cameras for photographing ground installations. Other cameras on board would make a record of the plane's radarscope during the flight. The combination would allow SAC not only to study the Soviet bases and combat aircraft in the Arctic region, but would also provide a sequence of radar images that could later help to guide pilots to the same targets at night or in bad weather. </p><p> Like most 1950s bombers, Austin's RB-47E was only lightly armed. Two M-24 20mm cannons were located in the tail. They could only be operated by remote control by the co-pilot if he swiveled around to face the rear. Bomber crews knew the guns were unreliable and would offer only a feeble defense against far more agile and heavily armed fighters. </p><p> Austin entered the hatch at the belly of the plane and climbed a short ladder to the cockpit, where he took his accustomed place in the front seat. Carl Holt, the co-pilot, was from Pittsburgh. He settled in behind Austin, divided by the co-pilot's instrument panel. A bubble canopy would cover them in flight. Heavilin, an Ohio native, descended a step to the navigator's quarters, a windowless space in the nose that was crammed with navigational instruments, a radar screen, and other equipment. There was just enough room in a cramped aisle alongside the pilots for the crew members to move about during the flight. </p><p> Austin powered up the engines, and with a deafening rumble, the plane rolled down the taxiway to await takeoff clearance from the control tower. The English countryside was a lush green from the spring rains. As the plane climbed into the sky shortly after 7 a.m., the tidy little village of Lechlade was visible below. The plane crossed over the meandering Thames River, which stretched east toward Oxford and on to London. </p><p> As agreed in advance with the other two crews that were flying with Austin that day, he took the lead as the three aircraft headed out over the North Sea. The flight plan called for the planes to refuel off the Norwegian coast, then proceed around the northern tip of Norway to a point 100 miles north of Murmansk, where the other two crews believed all three planes would turn back. </p><p> The tankers, also from the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, were waiting when Austin reached the preset rendezvous point off Stavanger, a port city on the southwest coast of Norway. In a delicate piece of aerial choreography that he had practiced dozens of times, Austin guided his plane under and slightly behind the tanker and slowed his speed. The long refueling boom was lowered from the plane toward Austin and into the RB-47E's receptacle. Once the connections were secure, thousands of gallons of jet fuel streamed into fuselage tanks. </p><p> From Stavanger, Austin proceeded northeast along the Norwegian coast for more than an hour, passing by Bergen and Trondheim. He soon crossed the Arctic circle. The northernmost region of Europe was now visible, a desolate, windblown landscape at the top of the world. At the far tip, Norway, Finland, and the Soviet Union coexisted uneasily by the Barents Sea. Murmansk was less than 150 miles down the coast from the Norwegian-Soviet border. </p><p> The moment to part company with the two other SAC aircraft had come. Heavilin checked the map and the aircraft heading, plotting a course toward Murmansk. He relayed the information to Austin, who then banked the plane to the right on a southeast flight path. As the plane slowly wheeled toward the Russian mainland, Austin could see the pilot and co-pilot of one of the other planes twist around and look at him in disbelief. Jimmy Valentine, the other pilot, was a good friend, and Austin waited tensely to see if he would break the radio blackout. He didn't, though he was mystified and alarmed by Austin's unexpected maneuver. </p><p> Within minutes, the Soviet coastline loomed in the distance, and, with it, the invisible dividing line between international and Soviet airspace. Austin was right on course. But after flying through the morning without generating contrails, the plane entered a new air mass, and its progress across the cloudless sky was clearly marked by a white ribbon stretching back to the horizon. The Russians didn't need a radar system to see that an unidentified intruder was coming their way. </p><p> They were waiting, on high alert. Unbeknownst to Austin, ten days earlier three British crews, using American RB-45C airplanes temporarily based at Sculthorpe Royal Air Force Base on England's east coast, had made a nighttime flight over the western Soviet Union. Soviet air defense forces around Kiev had unsuccessfully tried to shoot down one of the planes with antiaircraft fire. The two other aircraft were pursued by Soviet fighters, but escaped untouched. Commanders in Moscow were furious at the ineffectual performance, and the entire air defense system had been placed on heightened alert. </p><p> Heavilin switched on the cameras and Austin leveled the plane as it coasted in over Murmansk, a gritty seaport that served as the Soviet Union's main fishing and naval hub in the Arctic region. Directly below were the shipyards and concrete-block buildings that the Russians had erected in the inhospitable terrain to take advantage of the ice-free waters, warmed by the remnants of the Gulf Stream. One of Russia's most sensitive military installations, the submarine base at Severomorsk, was located not far up a narrow inlet that leads to the open sea. </p><p> As instructed, Austin had climbed to 40,000 as he neared the Soviet coast, even though the plane was carrying the fresh load of fuel it had picked up off Stavanger. The combination of weight and altitude reduced the plane's speed to about 510 mph. Austin had questioned the assigned altitude at the morning briefing, concerned that he would lose airspeed just as he penetrated Soviet airspace. There was no sign of Russian resistance as the RB-47 passed over its first targets, two airfields outside Murmansk. But as the crew completed the photographing of the second base, Holt spotted three fighters rising toward the American aircraft. The planes approached but made no effort to attack. They had apparently been scrambled into the air to get a better look at the intruder. </p><p> Austin, Holt, and Heavilin were determined to complete their mission, believing that their altitude and airspeed provided protection against any attack. The first group of Soviet planes dropped back toward their base. A second and then a third set appeared, but remained out of attack range below the Americans. Austin continued over the White Sea to Arkhangel'sk, where the crew photographed several other airfields. At that point, six new fighters roared into view, climbing rapidly toward the reconnaissance plane. As they got closer, Austin concluded that they were MiG-17s. </p><p> Austin ordered Holt to unbuckle himself from his seat so he could swivel around to see what the Russian planes were doing and get the guns ready for firing. Holt was just turning when Austin saw tracer rounds streaking above and below. Any illusions about invulnerability vanished instantly. "We had been identified as foe, and they were going to shoot us down if they could," he said. </p><p> He told Holt to return fire with the cannons, warning that the next attack run would come right up their tailpipes. The co-pilot got off two or three shots before the guns jammed. But the brief burst forced the pursuing jets to pull away from the prime firing position behind the American plane. Firing from 30 to 40 degrees to the side, the Russian pilots would not have as good a shot at disabling or destroying the plane. </p><p> Austin hollered, "The hell with this 40,000-foot bit. I'm gonna let down." Since the altitude wasn't proving any defense against the high-performance Russian planes, he wanted to descend to 37,000 feet, where he would pick up speed. "I pushed the nose over," he recalled. In an effort to outrun the Russians, he rammed forward the six throttles that controlled the plane's engines. </p><p> The plane accelerated to 550 mph as it descended, and Austin momentarily thought he might have eluded the pursuing jets. He turned toward the next airfield. As he was making the 45-degree turn to the left, the plane shuddered as a shell smashed into the top of the port wing, about 8 feet from the fuselage. It exploded on impact, knocking a jagged hole in the top of the wing and piercing the fuselage in a dozen spots in the area of the forward main wheel well and the number one main fuel tank. The largest hole was big enough for a football to fit through. Austin and Holt, seated forward of the wing, couldn't see the damage, but they knew the plane had been hit when the intercom system suddenly went dead. The Russian planes, possibly short on fuel and struggling to keep pace with the RB-47 as it picked up speed, broke off pursuit. Heavilin quickly calculated that the final airfield on their list was located along their escape route toward Finland, so Austin headed southwest toward that target. They got the photographs they wanted, then raced for the border. </p><p> Flying time to Finland woul...</p></p><h2>Ariadne&#39;s Thread: A Workbook of Goddess Magic</h2><p>Mountainwater, Shekhinah</p><p>Using the figure of the ancient goddess Ariadne as a metaphor, Mountainwater unravels the mysteries of a woman-centered spirituality. She offers gentle guidance through the cycles of a woman's life; the phases of the moon; the yearly nature holidays; and the aspects of divination. She concludes each chapter with suggested exercises, meditations, and reading lists. Her capably organized and well-written book encourages women to find their own spiritual path. The reading lists lack complete citations; still, a very good, practical book on women's spirituality and goddess worship. Recommended.<br><i>- Gail Wood, Mont gomery Coll.

At the very edge of Dimwood Forest stood an old charred oak where, silhouetted by the moon, a great horned owl sat waiting. The owl&#39;s name was Mr. Ocax, and he looked like death himself. With his piercing gaze, he surveyed the lands he called his own, watching for the creatures he considered his subjects. Not one of them ever dared to cross his path...until the terrible night when two little mice went dancing in the moonlight...</p><p><p>Ask Avi how you know when you're a real writer and his answer is simple: "I think you become a writer when you stop writing for yourself or your teachers and start thinking about readers." Avi made up his mind to do that when he was just a senior in high school.</p><p>Avi was born in 1937 in New York City and was raised in Brooklyn. Kids often ask him about his name. "My twin sister gave it to me when we were both about a year old. And it stuck." To this day, Avi is the only name the author uses.</p><p>As a kid, Avi says, he was "shy, not into sports, but someone who loved to read and play games of imagination." He did not consider himself a good student, though. "In elementary school I did well in science, but I was a poor writer. When I got to high school I failed all my courses. Then my folks put me in a small school that emphasized reading and writing." What made him want to become a writer? "Since writing was important to my family, friends and school, it was important to me. I wanted to prove that I could write. But it took years before I had a book published."</p><p>Avi didn't start off as an author of children's books but as a playwright. It was only when he had children of his own that he started to write for young people.</p><p>When asked if writing is hard for him, Avi gives an unequivocal YES. "But," he goes on, "it's hard for everyone to write well. I have to rewrite over and over again, so on average it takes me a year to write a book." Where does he get his ideas? "Everybody has ideas. The vital question is: What do you do with them? My wife, a college teacher, uses her ideas to understand literature. My rock musician sons shape their ideas in to music. I take my ideas and turn them into stories."</p><p>Avi's advice for people who want to write: "I believe reading is the key to writing. the more you read, the better your writing can be." He adds, "Listen, and watch the world around you. Don't be satisfied with answers others give you. Don't assume that because everyone believes a thing, that it is right or wrong. Reason things out for yourself. Work to get answers on your own. Understand why you believe things. Finally, write what you honestly feel, then learn from the criticism that will always come your way."Avi's many award-winning books for young readers include the Newbery Honor Books Nothing But the Truth and The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle, as well as more Tales from Dimwood Forest, including Poppy, winner of the Boston Globe/Horn Book Award, Poppy and Rye, and Ragweed. His many other books include tales of mystery, fantasy, and historical fiction for young readers of all ages.</p>Grade 3-5?A fast-paced, allegorical animal story. Mr. Ocax is a great horned owl who rules the mice who live around Dimwood Forest, preying on their fears by promising protection from the dreaded porcupine in exchange for unconditional obedience. Challenging his despotic authority is the smart-talking, earring-sporting golden mouse Ragweed, whose refusal to obey turns him into a meal for the owl. His timid sweetheart Poppy returns home, where she learns that a delegation must go to request permission from Mr. Ocax to relocate half of the mouse family as they have outgrown their present quarters. When he refuses, Poppy, inspired by Ragweed's independent thinking, decides to undertake the scouting journey to the proposed new home anyway, encountering along the way an irreverent porcupine who explains that he and his ilk are no threat to mice. Armed with Ragweed's earring, a quill sword, and the awareness of the owl's deception, she plans to expose Ocax as a cowardly bully. She finds herself in a fierce battle with him, resulting in his death and allowing for the mice's liberation. This exciting story is richly visual, subtly humorous, and skillfully laden with natural-history lessons. The anthropomorphism is believable and the characters are memorable. The underlying messages, to challenge unjust authority and to rely on logic and belief in oneself, are palatably blended with action and suspense. Black-and-white illustrations are in keeping with the changing moods and forest locale.

Perhaps you are now young and healthy and thinking, "Why worry about something most likely years in the future?" But when you are young and healthy is the very best time to start-with minimal emotional pressure to color your thoughts. Furthermore, as you well know but probably don't want to admit, you never know when your time, or the time of your loved ones, may come to cross over to the Great Beyond.<br><br>Fear not. Nothing you do or say now will be etched in stone. You can always make changes as your life circumstances, feelings, and beliefs alter. But without an initial template, waiting until the bitter end will make the task that much harder and perhaps even impossible to accomplish.<br><br>CHAPTER 1<br><br>Death Is Inevitable:<br><br>So Be Prepared<br><br>There's only one certainty in life, and that is sooner or later it will end. No matter how good a person you are, no matter how important your contribution to society, no matter how healthfully you eat and faithfully you exercise, you will not-you cannot-live forever. That is an incontrovertible fact from which you cannot-and should not-hide. Despite the best that modern medicine can offer, there is no cure for mortality.<br><br>Yet the overwhelming majority of people are ill prepared for their final days, or the final days of the people they love. Some people are superstitious. They harbor an irrational belief that thinking about death is inviting trouble. But the real trouble comes from not thinking about death well in advance. Others simply haven't bothered. Why not put off until tomorrow what you don't have to do today? But what if tomorrow is too late?.?.?.??<br><br>No matter what your age or the age of your loved ones, the time to prepare yourself for the inevitable is now. You never know when the end may come and whether you will be able to speak for yourself as it approaches.<br><br>Too many people wait until it is too late to determine how they wish to spend their final days.<br><br>Too many people have neither discussed nor recorded their end-?of-? life wishes with the people most likely to have a say in the matter.<br><br>Too many people are at risk of ending up like Terri Schiavo, locked in a vegetative state for years while their families fight over how to proceed.<br><br>Too many people spend their dying days suffering needlessly with intractable pain or plagued by futile medical interventions.<br><br>Too many people assume incorrectly that having written a living will, they are protected from unwanted interventions when death is near.<br><br>And too many families are unprepared for the sudden, unexpected death of a loved one-young, old, or in between.<br><br>The terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, claimed 2,996 lives, nearly all healthy people and many in their thirties and forties with young families. A more commonplace tragedy occurred in August 2006 when a flatbed truck loaded with bricks slammed into a car carrying the young Christmas family of Queens, New York. Charles, age forty, and Theresa Ann, age forty-?one, and their two-?year-?old daughter, Victoria, were killed, leaving their four-?year-?old daughter, Theresa, an orphan. The truck then overturned and crushed an SUV, taking the life of thirty-?seven-?year-?old Norma Ryan but sparing her two children, Peter, age twelve, and Samantha, six months old.<br><br>All of these, to say the least, were horrid, unexpected deaths. For most people nowadays, the Grim Reaper approaches with far more warning. In 1990 cancer overtook heart disease as the leading killer among Americans under age eighty-?five, which means the majority of Americans now die slowly.<br><br>Yet even when there are weeks, months, or even years to prepare for the inevitable, relatively few people acquire the knowledge and take the steps needed to be sure that the end of life is as peaceful and comfortable and, yes, as celebratory as it can be, and that those who will be left behind are not overly burdened with medical and financial responsibilities, unanswered questions, and unresolved guilt.<br><br>In days of yore when deaths, other than accidental ones, occurred mainly at home, entire families-even young children-were familiar with it. People died at all ages-in infancy, childhood, childbirth, as well as in old age-surrounded by their loved ones, not strangers in white coats. Death was a part of life and, sad though it may have been, most everyone accepted it as such. There were no respirators, feeding tubes, needles, and fluid-?filled pouches keeping people alive for weeks or months. No one had to decide when to turn off life-?prolonging machinery or stop treatments for an incurable disease.<br><br>The case of Terri Schiavo, the twenty-?six-?year-?old who lingered for fifteen years in a vegetative state sustained by a feeding tube while her family fought over the right to end her so-?called life is perhaps the most dramatic illustration of the need for everyone- young, old, and in between-to be prepared:<br><br>� To make your wishes known about how you want to be treated if you are unable to communicate them at the time.<br><br>� To officially designate someone you trust to speak for you when you cannot speak for yourself.<br><br>� To know how to find doctors who treat the whole person, not just the disease, and who will not abandon patients when cure or meaningful prolongation of life is no longer possible.<br><br>� To know how to enlist the aid of the medical profession so that comfort and dignity, not agony and terror, are the hallmarks of your loved one's final days.<br><br>� To know how to respond appropriately when someone is dying so that the final hours, days, weeks, or months of life are not needlessly traumatic and financially exhausting for you or your loved one.<br><br>� To recognize and understand what happens, physically and mentally, when death is imminent, when hand-?holding and reassurance, not food or drink or an oxygen mask or CPR, is the proper course of action.<br><br>� To have a properly executed will so that your heirs will know how you wanted your assets distributed and will not become enemies battling over inheritance rights.<br><br>� And perhaps most important of all, to assign guardians for your underage children, along with a means to support them, if possible, should they become orphaned by the death of both parents.<br><br>It has been nearly forty years since Dr. Elisabeth K�bler-?Ross's best-?selling book, On Death and Dying, turned this long-?taboo subject into a socially accepted topic of conversation. Once the door had been opened, other books for the general reader followed: Final Gifts by Maggie Callahan and Patricia Kelly in 1992, How We Die by Sherwin Nuland in 1994, The Good Death by Marilyn Webb in 1997, Peaceful Dying by Daniel R. Tobin in 1999, The Needs of the Dying by David Kessler in 2000, On Grief and Grieving by Elisabeth K�bler-? Ross and David Kessler in 2005, Last Rights by Stephen P. Kiernan in 2006, and Final Conversations: Helping the Living and the Dying Talk to Each Other by Maureen P. Keeley and Julie M. Yingling in 2007, among others.<br><br>Since Dr. K�bler-?Ross opened the floodgates, many who work in the health care industry-nurses, physicians, social workers, chaplains- have written widely on the subject of death and dying in articles published in leading medical journals. Indeed, the Journal of the American Medical Association published an entire issue on the subject in 2000 and regularly runs articles under the rubric "Perspectives on Care at the Close of Life."<br><br>The American Journal of Nursing ran a yearlong series on caring for patients at the end of life. And many other leading journals-the Archives of Internal Medicine, the Annals of Internal Medicine, the New England Journal of Medicine, and the British journals the Lancet and BMJ, among others-have collectively published scores of research studies and discussions intended to enlighten physicians and other health care professionals about how best to cope with the myriad medical, ethical, and humane concerns that emerge when patients approach the end of life.<br><br>Still, there is so much ignorance about and resistance to this subject, much to the disservice of people who are dying and those who love and care for them. Avoidance and denial, not acceptance, are the states most commonly associated with the end of life, among physicians as well as laypeople like you and me.<br><br>For example, none of this information managed to penetrate the psyche of the leading oncologist who treated my friend Frank Crewdson in 1998 following a diagnosis of a relatively rare lung cancer unrelated to smoking. When it became obvious that the treatment the doctor had prescribed in hopes of "buying time" for his patient was not working, he sent in one of his henchmen-<br><br>a physician who had had no prior contact with Frank-to tell him, "There's nothing else we can give you."<br><br>It was as blunt a death sentence as could be delivered, and Frank, who was alone at the time, had no one to help soften the blow. Furthermore, his physician never saw Frank again, never came in to say, "We tried our best, but I'm very sorry that our best was simply not good enough. We can promise, however, to make you as comfortable as possible."<br><br>Nonetheless, changes are taking place in how dying patients are treated, thanks largely to the hospice movement and to the ongoing debates about physician-?assisted deaths. A new medical specialty called palliative medicine, which focuses on alleviating patients' symptoms and delivering humane medical care to patients whether they are expected to live or die, is gaining ground in hospitals nationwide. If properly executed, palliative care can obviate the need for laws to permit assisted suicides. Patients facing a protracted, fatal illness can spend their last days in comfort, saying their good-?byes, imparting their wisdom, healing wounded relationships, and expressing their love and appreciation to family and friends.<br><br>Ordinary people today are speaking more openly about loved ones afflicted with diseases like cancer, AIDS, and dementia. It is less and less common in newspaper obituaries for people to die "after a long illness."<br><br>Now the task at hand is to help millions of people like you to face up to the inevitable long before it will be necessary to put those preparations into action. You just never know. Remember Terri Schiavo was only twenty-?six years old.<br><br>You can-you must, for your own sake and the sake of those you love- help to change the culture of denial and avoidance to one of acceptance and preparation. You and your heirs will be glad you did.<br><br>FOR FURTHER READING<br><br>Kiernan, Stephen P. Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2006.<br><br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>A Good Death: There's More<br><br>Than One Right Way to Die<br><br>Death gives life meaning. Without death every birth would be a tragedy," Dr. Richard Smith wrote as editor of BMJ, the British medical journal. He recalled Jonathan Swift's writing in Gulliver's Travels:<br><br>Gulliver was vastly excited when he traveled to Laputa and heard of the Strudbruggs, the immortals. He imagined them with their "minds free and disengaged, without the weight and depression of Spirits caused by the continual Apprehension of Death." In fact, they were the most miserable of people. One of their "prevailing Passions" was envy of the deaths of the old.<br><br>Some people would say there is no such thing as a "good death"-that all deaths, except perhaps the deaths of terrorists and violent criminals, are necessarily unwanted and unwelcome. That may well be true when you are young, healthy, physically and mentally intact or, if not all of the above, at least still able to enjoy the good things and people in your life.<br><br>But what if you are very old and sick and no longer able to care for yourself? What if you become demented and no longer recognize or care about the people you loved? What if you have an incurable, untreatable illness that has progressed to the point where death is, as Hamlet put it, "a consummation devoutly to be wished?"<br><br>At such points, death might be a welcomed exit from an existence that has become intolerable or meaningless.<br><br>But I've discovered from people I've known and others I've read about, there is no one definition of a good death. Just as we have followed different paths in life, each of us must decide for ourselves how we want to be treated when death is near-where we want to be and with whom, and feeling, thinking, and doing what best suits us as individuals.<br><br>Some people, like my late friend Frank Crewdson, prefer the "security" of being in a hospital surrounded by equipment and medicines that can assuage any crisis, at least temporarily. Others, like my late friends Jessica Wing and Mickey Martinez, prefer to die at home surrounded by familiar, caring faces and caressed by their tender, loving hands and kisses.<br><br>Some, especially those with a deep, abiding faith, are ready to "meet their Maker" whereas others may refuse to acknowledge the approach of the Grim Reaper and insist that everything possible be done to treat their illness and keep them alive for as long as possible.<br><br>The five stages of death-denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance, so brilliantly described in 1969 by Dr. Elisabeth K�bler-?Ross-are universal only in the sense that different people choose to die at different stages. In death as in life, there are different strokes for different folks. There is no one "right way" to die.<br><br>What can make dying especially painful for both the dying and those they will leave behind is when the two are at different, incompatible stages and neither is willing or able to budge:<br><br>� The patient is in denial while the family has accepted the inevitable and only wishes the patient would prepare for it as well.<br><br>� The patient has accepted the fact that death is near but loved ones keep scouring the Internet and insisting that this, that, or the other therapy-however outrageous-be tried when all the patient wants is to be left to die in peace.<br><br>� The family is unable to relinquish anger over what they believe to be medical mistreatment-a missed diagnosis or improper therapy- while the patient has moved beyond anger to accepting the fact that doctors are human and mishaps are sometimes unavoidable.<br><br>� The family is so grief-?stricken that no one can "hear" the patient's attempts to settle unfinished business, express previously unsaid feelings, and bring life to a peaceful closure.</p><h2>Quilting Inside the Lines: Machine &amp; Frame Quilting (Golden Threads)</h2><p>&#34;New design-with-lines technique that is perfect for domestic sewing or longarm quilting machines.

I was way too familiar with the vagaries of murder.</p><p>I had seen it flex its muscles on the cracked pavement of New York City sidewalks and behind grimy stairwells in housing projects. I knew that doormen in the most expensive properties lining Central Park were often as powerless to stop it from entering the dwellings they guarded as the less fortunate who encountered it in random exchanges with strangers on the street.</p><p>I had comforted many of the shattered lives that murder left in its wake, and tried to do justice for them in a court of law for more than a dozen years.</p><p>But I had never held death in my arms until tonight. I had never cradled a killer&#x2019;s prey against my body&#x2014;a life extinguished in an instant, while the blood dripped out onto my chest and pooled in my lap until the police arrived to release me from death&#x2019;s grip.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to stay in here, Ms. Cooper,&#x201d; the older of the two uniformed cops said to me. &#x201c;The medical examiner says you can wait in her office.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m good for now,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not healthy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What you&#x2019;re doing, that is. Staring at a dead man.&#x201d;</p><p>I was standing in the autopsy room at the morgue, about ten feet away from the body of the District Attorney, less than an hour after he taken two bullets to the head.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just&#x2014;I&#x2019;m just thinking, officer. This is where I need to be at the moment.&#x201d;</p><p>The younger cop was at the far end of the metal gurney, facing me, as expressionless and erect as a soldier of the Royal Guard at Buckingham Palace.</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Palmer&#x2019;s got a change of clothes for you, ma&#x2019;am. She thought you&#x2019;d be more comfortable if you got out of those bloody things, after the Crime Scene guys take pictures of you.&#x201d;</p><p>There wasn&#x2019;t much left of Paul Battaglia&#x2019;s skull. I didn&#x2019;t have the best angle of vision to see it, leaning against the counter where some of the tools were laid out, but that fact was pretty clear to me.</p><p>I lifted the glass of Scotch to my face and ran it back and forth under my nose. Jeremy Mayers, counsel to the Chief Medical Examiner, was a snob about his single malts. That trait, at a bar after hours, usually irked me. I was fine with a few shots of Dewar&#x2019;s on the rocks. But in this cheerless space, reeking of formalin, the stronger concentration of my favorite amber liquid&#x2014;without ice&#x2014;helped me deal with the pervasive odor of death. Jeremy had poured me a snoutful from his private stash.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you hear me, Ms. Cooper?&#x201d; the older cop said. &#x201c;We can go down the hall and wait for the homicide team there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said, inhaling the peat-soaked flavor of Jeremy&#x2019;s Laguvulin before I lowered the glass to my mouth and took a sip. &#x201c;I did hear you. I&#x2019;m not ready to go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just so you know we can, soon as you&#x2019;re ready.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We? Aren&#x2019;t you here to stand watch over the DA&#x2019;s body?&#x201d;</p><p>Paul Battaglia wasn&#x2019;t a candidate to lie in state anywhere, but it would be tradition for an NYPD honor guard to be with the body until his burial.</p><p>&#x201c;No, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; the officer said, pointing to his silent young comrade. &#x201c;The kid&#x2019;s got Battaglia tonight. I&#x2019;ve got you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Me</i>?&#x201d; That line got my attention. &#x201c;What are talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got orders to stay with you, Ms. Cooper.&#x201d;</p><p>I bridled at the suggestion. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the morgue. I&#x2019;m a prosecutor who works with these docs and technicians every day. The dead man is my boss. I&#x2019;ve got Detective Chapman here and a posse of detectives on the way,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not in any danger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody said you were.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then what did they tell you, Officer? Why have they got you glued to me? I&#x2019;m not the suspect in this tragedy either.&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged off my comment and looked away from me.</p><p>&#x201c;The district attorney fell into my arms when he was shot, do you understand that?&#x201d; I had started to gesture with my hands, quickly catching myself so no Scotch would slosh over the rim of the drinking glass and be lost to me. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t kill him, I caught him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever you say, ma&#x2019;am. Orders is orders.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look, can you please go find Chapman and ask him to come here?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Manhattan North Homicide? That Chapman?&#x201d; the officer asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Mike. Tell Mike I need him, please.&#x201d;</p><p>The officer looked at the rookie, who made eye contact with him and nodded his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about leaving us,&#x201d; I said to my anxious captor. &#x201c;If I run, just send an APB to the nearest laundromat. That&#x2019;s about as far as I can get without being collared.&#x201d;</p><p>The older man turned and left the room.</p><p>I took another sip to steel my nerves and walked closer to the gurney.</p><p>Paul Battaglia had hired me out of law school at the University of Virginia. He was a legendary figure in national prosecutorial circles, Manhattan&#x2019;s elected district attorney for more than three decades. I had idolized him as one of the kids on his great legal staff&#x2014;five hundred lawyers in all.</p><p>Paul had been good to me from the outset, and I had risen quickly when he tapped me to lead the country&#x2019;s pioneering Special Victims Unit at an unusually early stage in my career. With his complete backing, the lawyers in my unit had created innovative techniques to get more victims access to the courtroom and had fought vigorously for legislative reform.</p><p>When I reached the side of the district attorney, I put my hand on his outstretched palm. It was cold now, of course, and it didn&#x2019;t respond to my touch, as I knew it wouldn&#x2019;t. But I did it to make myself feel better&#x2014;putting my fingers around his, offering some sign of affection in this steel-structured room, which was the most lifeless place I&#x2019;d ever known.</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t touch the body, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; the young cop said. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, Officer.&#x201d;</p><p>My feelings about the district attorney had been less than generous throughout this past year, but despite my discomfort level about his integrity, I found myself welling up with tears. I gently patted the sleeve of Battaglia&#x2019;s dark suit. &#x201c;Good night, Paul,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;Rest in peace.&#x201d;</p><p>There would be no answers to the flood of questions that had overwhelmed me from the moment I had heard him call out my name in the late night semi-darkness and walk toward me&#x2014;quite unexpectedly&#x2014;up the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><p>I braced myself now to look at his face, or what was left of it, one more time. One of the bullets&#x2014;the one that penetrated Battaglia&#x2019;s skull and landed behind me, taking along bits of his brain&#x2014;had blown an eye out as it exited. The other piece of lead presumably lodged in the bony cartilage of his cranium, maybe blocked by the base of the classic Roman nose that accented his patrician appearance.</p><p>I walked slowly, circling the gurney, which caused the rookie cop to begin to fidget.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I won&#x2019;t touch him again,&#x201d; I said to the kid. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worked for the man for a long time. I can&#x2019;t believe this has happened to him.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t believe it had happened to me, either, but that was a rather self-serving observation, of no importance to anyone else.</p><p>Paul Battaglia&#x2019;s body was part of the crime scene, which stretched from Fifth Avenue, where the shooter had leaned out a car window to fire at&#x2014;well, presumably at the District Attorney&#x2014;to the museum entrance, several yards from where I had been standing.</p><p>The blasts had been so powerful that when Battaglia was struck and fell forward, he was lifted out of one of his shoes. The black-laced wing-tip was still on his right foot, but his left foot, covered in a dark gray sock with black dots, rested on the gurney as though he had started the process of undressing for the night.</p><p>The strong odor of formalin in the room&#x2014;already coating my hair and clothing, as it always did&#x2014;made me cough. I finished my circumnavigation of the body and returned to my post against the counter, sticking my nose into the glass of Scotch to steady myself.</p><p>I kept thinking of things I wanted to know, but I wouldn&#x2019;t get any answers from the man on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Officer,&#x201d; I said, walking back over to the gurney and leaning against the left side of it. &#x201c;I wonder if you can tell me&#x2014;has anyone else from my office been here to see Mr. Battaglia yet? I mean before I came in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know, Ms. Cooper. I got pulled off scooter patrol in the precinct to be here, like half an hour ago. I relieved the cops who rode with the morgue van to bring the DA down.&#x201d;</p><p>One of the city&#x2019;s great columnists&#x2014;often quoted to us by Battaglia&#x2014;once said, &#x201c;Never kill anyone in a landmark location.&#x201d; First, because you make yourself instantly notorious for media purposes, and secondly because the site itself was always compromised by a crush of onlookers.</p><p>I had never seen a body removed from a crime scene faster than Paul Battaglia was carted off from in front of the Met. The Costume Institute Gala had ended a short time before&#x2014;with hundreds of well-dressed fashion industry elites filling the sidewalks to find black cars and Ubers&#x2014;and in a city that never sleeps, the museum&#x2019;s Fifth Avenue venue on the eastern perimeter of Central Park was always a magnet for rubberneckers, day or night.</p><p>Mike Chapman had pulled me back into the Museum&#x2014;security made a path for us&#x2014;and out through a basement door for the ride down here to the morgue. The corpse made better time than we did.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Cooper, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; the rookie said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re leaning against the gurney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just my hand on the metal rim, officer.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t stop looking at the still figure that had been so very alive two hours earlier.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s blood all over your outfit, Ms. Cooper. You don&#x2019;t want to be contaminating the DA&#x2019;s clothing, do you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s dry, officer. I promise you that,&#x201d; I said, looking down at the stained front of my borrowed sweatshirt and leggings.</p><p>&#x201c;Still, it could fleck off and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; I said, taking two steps back, clasping my glass with both hands.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to put you off, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; the officer said, eyes face forward again. &#x201c;You mind my asking what he was like?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Paul Battaglia? Most people would say he was the best in the business.&#x201d;</p><p>For me, his character was much more complicated. He had been district attorney longer than most New Yorkers could remember. His campaign slogan&#x2014;from his first run through eight terms&#x2014;had been you can&#x2019;t play politics with people&#x2019;s lives. But he had lost sight of that sentiment somewhere along the way and was more adept at using people for political purposes than Machiavelli had been.</p><p>&#x201c;This must be so difficult for you,&#x201d; the cop said.</p><p>&#x201c;It is.&#x201d; But not for the reasons he or anyone who wasn&#x2019;t close to me would think. I had once been so devoted to Battaglia that I never looked for flaws, or I had been blind enough that I hadn&#x2019;t seen them. Much more recently, I had become disillusioned with the man. I distrusted some of his alliances with corrupt figures among the city&#x2019;s satellite players, just as he had taken to undermining and second-guessing many of my investigative tactics.</p><p>It was difficult for me because Paul Battaglia and I had unfinished business, and now there were things that we could never resolve.</p><p>I bowed my head and looked again. There was just a slight indentation in the skin on the fourth finger of his left hand where Battaglia had once worn a wedding ring. For reasons unknown to me, he had taken that off months ago.</p><p>I lifted the drinking glass and placed it against my forehead. Had it been my usual cocktail, with ice, it would have refreshed me and anesthetized my pounding headache. But this motion was just a senseless habit that was no help to me at all.</p><p>The door opened and closed behind me. I didn&#x2019;t look up.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the old man doing, Coop?&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;You making sure he&#x2019;s still dead?&#x201d;</p><p>The comment took the rookie by surprise. His eyebrows raised and his expression changed. It was obvious he&#x2019;d never met Mike Chapman before.</p><p>&#x201c;Actually, I&#x2019;m making sure that if Battaglia has a glimmer of life in him and has anything left to say, he says it to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unanswered questions,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;I know you don&#x2019;t like &#x2019;em, Coop, but very few people check out leaving a tidy package behind for their heirs, professional or personal&#x2014;especially when the Grim Reaper shows up out of the blue like this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why the hell was he rushing up the museum steps, after midnight, saying he had to talk to me?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;To rip you a new one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now what makes you think that?&#x201d; I said, turning to face Mike. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s stooping lower than I would go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really? I&#x2019;ll have to reset the bar a little higher. I thought you were as low as you could possibly get,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;Cause all Battaglia&#x2019;s done lately is criticize you. Here you are, on a leave of absence, and you disobey all his orders to stay out of a case. Instead, you bring it to a head in front of an audience&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t do anything to make the case break last night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t whine, Coop. It doesn&#x2019;t become you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Break it you did, with the Police Commissioner doing an instant presser at the Museum, without waiting for the District Attorney, and crediting you for your involvement, too. Maybe Battaglia was charging up to butt heads with you again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What happened to the days when he and I trusted each other implicitly?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2014;his fair-haired golden girl? Long gone, those days,&#x201d; Mike said, taking the glass of Scotch from my hand. &#x201c;And drinking too much of this embalming fluid won&#x2019;t help, either.&#x201d;</p><p>I grabbed his wrist to hold the glass in place and breathed in one more shot of Scotch. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t drinking, Mike. I was sipping. Sniffing and sipping.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No games, girl. This is all unfolding live, in prime time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Take me home, then,&#x201d; I said, glancing back over my shoulder at Battaglia. &#x201c;Just take me home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a trick not even Houdini could pull off,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;No disappearing acts, according to Commissioner Scully.&#x201d;</p><p>I stepped forward to press myself against Mike&#x2019;s chest and feel his arms around me. He pulled back faster than I could get to him. &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have you photographed in this getup before we hand over your clothing to the detectives.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You saw everything I did, Mike,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You talk to the guys tonight. They can interview me tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any witness ever said that to you, Madame Prosecutor, and you&#x2019;d start waterboarding her on the spot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so tired, Mike. I&#x2019;m so sick to my gut and frightened and confused,&#x201d; I said. Then I swiveled in place to take another look at the late Paul Battaglia. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s a part of me that feels really guilty about this.&#x201d;</p><p>The rookie cop turned to look at me.</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t hear that, kid,&#x201d; Mike said, shaking his finger at the young officer. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not talking guilt as a matter of law.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I feel&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No more running off at the mouth, Coop. You didn&#x2019;t fire the gun, okay, did you? That&#x2019;s guilt with a capital <i>G</i>. We don&#x2019;t know what the fuck was going on with the District Attorney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing good, Mike. You know that for sure. Whatever it is, it got him killed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon. Crime Scene needs photos of you in your Halloween costume.

Jan Morris shows clearly the manners of thought of the Welch people, as well as their art, their landscapes and their folklore, their ways of earning a living, their character, their meaning and their historical destiny. Half Welsh, half English herself, Morris is a historian, a travel writer, and an essayist. All three disciplines she brings to this work--a vivid tribute to a country not just on the map or in the mind but also in the heart. "All of us," Morris writes, "have some small country there."<br> <br> About the Author:<br> <br> Jan Morris is the author of such books as the Pax Britannica trilogy, Spain, Destinations, and most recently, Journeys.<br> <br></p><p></p><h2>Castle: How It Works (My Readers)</h2><p><p>Take a tour of a medieval castle.</p><p>Every part of the castle has a function. Walls keep the enemy out. Towers protect the lord and the soldiers. From the moat and portcullis to the great hall and dungeon, see how a castle works as an enemy army tries to storm the walls. </p><p><i>Castle: How It Works </i>is a <i>Kirkus Reviews </i>Best Children's Book of 2012</p></p><p><p>David Macaulay is the author and illustrator of more than twenty-five books including Cathedral, Pyramid, and Castle. His ground-breaking The Way Things Work has become a modern classic. He won the Caldecott Medal for Black and White. He lives in Vermont.</p>*Starred Review* Let&#x2019;s face it. Macaulay wrote the book on castles: his Caldecott Honor winner Castle (1977), later reenvisioned as part of Built to Last (2010). Now he revisits the topic with a younger audience and a new purpose in mind, recalling in an introductory note that as a kid, he didn&#x2019;t like reading, but he found that pictures made it more fun. Actually, with lines like &#x201c;Archers will greet you with flaming arrows,&#x201d; the text here is fun, too. As the narrative begins, a castle stands on a hill, while would-be attackers skulk on another hill in the foreground. Short sentences offer plenty of intriguing information about the castle, its inhabitants, and their many means of defense. Readers are occasionally addressed informally, &#x201c;Are you friend or foe?&#x201d; Pretty soon, the attackers make their move. Despite their alarming weapons (battering rams, catapults), it&#x2019;s clear that in the end, the defenders will prevail. The format is slightly larger than a typical book for beginning readers, giving a bit more scope for the illustrations: strong line drawings with color washes. The use of different perspectives and cross sections is particularly fine. A promising start for Macaulay&#x2019;s new My Readers series of nonfiction. Grades K-3. --Carolyn Phelan</p><h2>Under the Dragon&#39;s Tail</h2><p>Detective William Murdoch takes on the rigid hierarchy of turn-of-the-century Toronto as he investigates a brutal murder tied to a mysterious birth many years earlier</p><p>Maureen Jennings sets up this 19th-century tale of blackmail and murder rather like a jigsaw puzzle: each chapter introduces new clues, new characters, and new points of view until the complete picture is revealed. As we discover who might have suffocated Dolly Shaw, a capricious, demanding drunkard, Jennings explores the permutations and stratifications of society in Toronto at the close of the century. Although the victim is a violent, scheming wretch of humble dwelling and few connections, her death draws in the range of men and women who employed her services in her profession as a midwife: the wife of a prominent judge who seems to care for little except fashionable clothes and her young ward; a theatrical performer who sells her various talents both before and behind the stage; and the detective, William Murdoch, who tries to solve the mystery and appease his own loneliness after the death of his fianc�e. <p> Jennings has a subtle touch. She not only explores Canadian society caught between the stiffer British and the more freewheeling Americans but also considers the period's reliance on patent medicines for everything from inducing miscarriages to promoting virility; examines the shifting athletic interests after the introduction of the bicycle; and evokes the stink of stale beer sold cheaply to the city's poor. Her ear for 19th-century language is more true and her evil deeds are less foul than those of Anne Perry. And while she lacks the rollicking good humor of Elizabeth Peters (although there are a few light moments), she is much more accessible than the sometimes impermeable Peter Ackroyd. <i>Under the Dragon's Tail</i> is a worthwhile book and a solid follow-up to Jennings's first, <i>Except the Dying</i>. <i>--K.A.

Along with The Knights of Bushido: A Short History of Japanese War Crimes by the same author, it was a phenomenal bestseller when first published. Drawing on documentary evidence submitted to the Nuremberg trials and brilliantly written by an expert intimately connected to the prosecution of war criminals, this searing condemnation of the Third Reich&#39;s crimes is factual, objective and unstinting in its efforts to expose the truth behind real or alleged atrocities. It examines Hitler&#39;s instruments of tyranny - the SS, Gestapo and Army - and repression; German crimes against prisoners of war; outrages committed on the high seas; crimes against civilian populations; the mass use of slave labor; the concentration camps; and the &#39;Final Solution&#39; of the Jewish question. Lord Russell&#39;s text examines such infamous crimes as the execution of 10,000 prisoners per day at Auschwitz; the massacre at Lidice; the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto; the death of 4,000,000 Soviet prisoners of war in German hands; the lynching of Allied airmen; the Malmedy massacre; and presents damning evidence against individual German officers and the merciless regime which oversaw their evil activities.</p><p>Lord Russell of Liverpool served in World Wars I and II and acted as Deputy Judge Advocate General for the British Army of the Rhine, giving legal advice on the prosecution of war criminals in the British zone of occupied Germany.</p><h2>Mazes and Labyrinths</h2><p><br> This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Raboteau Book Prize for the Best Book in Africana Religions<br><br>Demonstrates that the efforts to contest conventional racial categorization contributed to broader discussions in black America that still resonate today.&nbsp; &nbsp; When Joseph Nathaniel Beckles registered for the draft in the&nbsp;1942, &nbsp;he rejected the&nbsp;racial&nbsp;categories presented to him and persuaded the registrar to cross out the check mark she had placed next to Negro and substitute "Ethiopian Hebrew."&nbsp; "God did not make us Negroes," declared religious leaders in black communities of the early twentieth-century urban North. They insisted that so-called Negroes are, in reality, Ethiopian Hebrews, Asiatic Muslims, or raceless children of God. Rejecting conventional American racial classification, many black southern migrants and immigrants from the Caribbean embraced these alternative visions of black history, racial identity, and collective future, thereby reshaping the black religious and racial landscape.&nbsp; <br> Focusing on the Moorish Science Temple, the Nation of Islam, Father Divine's Peace Mission Movement, and a number of congregations of Ethiopian Hebrews, Judith Weisenfeld argues that the appeal of these groups lay not only in the new religious opportunities membership provided, but also in the novel ways they formulated a religio-racial identity. Arguing that members of these groups understood their religious and racial identities as divinely-ordained and inseparable, the book examines how this sense of self shaped their conceptions of their bodies, families, religious and social communities, space and place, and political sensibilities.&nbsp;<br> <br> Weisenfeld draws on extensive archival research and incorporates a rich array of sources&nbsp;to highlight the experiences of average members. The book demonstrates that the efforts by members of these movements to contest conventional racial categorization contributed to broader discussions in black America about the nature of racial identity and the collective future of black people that still resonate today.</p><p><b>Judith Weisenfeld</b> is Agate Brown and George L.

She is the author of Hollywood Be Thy Name: African American Religion in American Film, 1929-1949 and African American Women and Christian Activism: New York&#x2019;s Black YWCA, 1905-1945."Central to Weisenfelds study is her great, resolute fascination with the fact that these black people believed rather than being fixated on what they believed. New World A-Coming is a welcome addition to a burgeoning field of books seeking to expand and eventually redefine the parameters of African American religious history writ large." (<i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>"New World A-Coming is a masterful work of religious history. Weisenfelds analysis pushes our understanding of the ways in which black religioracial movements of the early 20th century functioned as far more than mere urban cults, inviting us to reimagine their meanings. The book is a significant contribution to the study of religious narratives and their role in shaping African-American identity and community in the past and the present." (<i>Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion</i>)<br><br>"Weisenfelds new work is a breath of fresh air in studies of the Great Migration. She expands our knowledge of the religious landscape of African descended migrants and immigrants in new ways and demonstrates the ingenuity and intricacies of race negotiation by African peoples living during the interwar years in America." (<i>Journal of the American Academy of Religion</i>)<br><br>"New World A-Coming is exquisite history and enfleshed theory. Even more, it is a philosophical manifestation of lifework that results from the seasoned rigor and intellectual deft that come only through the long-term of labor[The] book will certainly become a commanding guide for contemporary scholars and a classic source for future generations seeking to navigate the arduous craft of elucidating and interpreting the history of African American religions." (<i>Church History</i>)<br><br>"For too long Christianity has reigned over our histories of African America. This book definitively establishes the plurality of black religious experience and the definitive role religions had in the formation of twentieth-century racial identity. Reading unconventional sources and unearthing forgotten (but now unforgettable) figures, Weisenfeld offers an exemplary study of religion as a form of social and cultural criticism. There is no historian working with greater precision in the study of religion in America today." (Kathryn Lofton,Yale University)<br><br>"Judith Weisenfelds thorough examination of the role of religion in shaping African American identity and community during the social and physical shifts of black migration to the urban North emphasizes the multifaceted nature of religion for black communities as a source of material and psychical sustenance." (<i>Journal of Southern Religion</i>)<br><br>"Innovatively researched, elegantly written, and persuasively argued, Judith Weisenfelds new history of African American religious groups is a major contribution to the study of African American religions during the Great Migration. Weisenfeld deftly uses draft records, death certificates, immigration forms, and other bureaucratic documents to breathe life into the stories of Southern migrants, Northern residents, and Caribbean immigrants who joined Jewish, Muslim, and other prophetic religious movements. These new religious movements, Weisenfeld reveals, resisted racial identities imposed upon them by an increasingly powerful state and fellow American citizens alike. Their religious commitments, expressed not only in a rich theological imagination but also in material culture, ritual activity, and institution-building, created new collective racial identities invested in the redemption of Black peoplehood. Weisenfelds beautifully rendered story will engage both scholars and general readers interested in religion, U.S. history, and Africana studies." (Edward E. Curtis IV,Millennium Chair of the Liberal Arts, Indiana University &#x2013; Purdue University Indianapolis)<br><br>"This book is the most thorough and sophisticated treatment of the emergence and early development of these religio-racial movements...Anyone seeking to understand the role of religion and race in American life, and in particular the religious imagination and religious practices of specific black religio-racial movements in the interwar period would do well to read carefully Weisenfelds exemplary monograph."

With this new evidence, Rees explores the truth behind the war, its ruthless leaders and devastating effects on the military and civilian populations of both sides.</p><br></p><p>Labeling the Second World War battles between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia on the Eastern Front as the <i>War of the Century</i> is asking for trouble. What about the First World War, not to mention the other theaters of the 1939-45 conflict? Laurence Rees argues that the brutality of the fighting was unprecedented and that the outcome, with the annihilation of the German troops, was pivotal to the Allies' eventual victory. On both counts, he is absolutely right. The severe cold, hunger, shelling, and hand-to-hand street-fighting decimated both sides, and the casualties ran into the millions. And, yes, Germany never did recover neither physically nor mentally. The supposedly unbeatable one had been beaten. But does this make it a war of the century? To decontextualize the Eastern Front is to miss the bigger picture. This was not just a war between two competing ideologies--Communism and Nazism. The Russians, whatever their politics, were Britain's and America's allies; they may have had a separate private agenda in the war--what country didn't?--but they were on the right side and part of an overall allied effort. Moreover, Rees's position lets the Germans off the hook somewhat. It allows them to make the revisionist claim that they were fighting Communism--something that became a holy cause in the West in the postwar years. They weren't. They were Nazis fighting the Allies. End of story. Rees also goes on to make the somewhat bizarre claim that the German defeat unleashed the Holocaust against the Jews. This will come as a massive surprise to the millions of Jews who were persecuted in the 10 years prior to 1943. It is true that the death camps went into overdrive after the defeat in Russia, but this would almost certainly also have happened if the Germans had won. The result on the Eastern Front was immaterial. However, there is also much to recommend in <i>War of the Century</i>. The comparisons between Hitler's Nazi Germany and Stalin's state capitalist U.S.S.R. are well made. Repression and contempt for life existed on both sides. Rees has found much new material from the newly opened Soviet archives and has also turned up many eyewitnesses from both sides, and their accounts provide a compellingly readable narrative. For this alone, the book is worth reading. At times it feels as if Rees is being willfully controversial simply to be noticed. But he needn't have bothered, because there was a fascinating book there anyway. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i>Laurence Rees, writer and producer of the BBC television series The Nazis, is the creative director of history programs for BBC Television.

She and her husband, artist Ken Raney, make their home in their native Kansas.The Face of the Earth 1<p></p> <br>Friday, September 3<br> <br>Mitchell Brannon fastened his seatbelt and navigated his Saturn through the Sylvia High School parking lot. &#x201c;Good riddance,&#x201d; he muttered, tossing a look over his shoulder at the rundown brick school building. Most of the time he loved his job, but this school year had gotten off to a rocky start and&#x2014;today anyway&#x2014;he would hand over his principal&#x2019;s &#x201c;badge&#x201d; in a heartbeat.<br> <br>Too bad the weather had taken a turn that felt more like the advent of winter than Labor Day. He flipped on the wipers and waited for them to whisk away the raindrops collecting on the windshield. At least it wasn&#x2019;t freezing.<br> <br>He hoped Jill hadn&#x2019;t hit any weather on her way home from Kansas City today. But as much as his wife hated driving in the rain, from their phone call last night he knew she was ready to be home. He stopped at the entrance to the street, dug his cell phone from his pocket, and punched in her number.<br> <br>It went straight to voice mail. She was probably in that dead zone around Oak Ridge. That or she forgot to charge her phone. &#x201c;Hey, you,&#x201d; he said, when the beep sounded. &#x201c;Just wondering where you are. Give me a call so I know when to start the steaks.&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;d had to do some fast talking to convince his wife to take a couple of days away from a classroom of third graders who adored her and to make time for this professional development conference. But he knew it would be a good distraction for Jill. Their last little bird had flown the nest last weekend, and Jill had been in mourning ever since.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d delivered Katie to the University of Kansas on Sunday, and from the gallon of tears Jill had shed since, you&#x2019;d have thought they&#x2019;d buried the girl instead of merely transporting her over the Missouri state line. Even though it was nice having Evan and Katie at the same college, their kids were almost six hours from home, and it had hit Jill hard.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d contemplated heading to their lake cabin to celebrate their first weekend as empty nesters, but because Jill had been at the conference since Wednesday, she&#x2019;d talked him into a &#x201c;stay-cation&#x201d;&#x2014;something she&#x2019;d read about in her latest women&#x2019;s magazine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told him, &#x201c;it would be silly to go somewhere and spend money we can&#x2019;t afford when we finally have the whole house to ourselves.&#x201d;<br> <br>The house-to-themselves aspect sounded promising. She agreed not to mope and tried to wheedle a promise out of him to not do any yard work or watch any football.<br> <br>Now that was pushing it. &#x201c;How about I&#x2019;ll help you grade papers if I can watch football?&#x201d;<br> <br>She&#x2019;d cocked her head, a spark lighting her eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see your football and raise you steaks on the grill.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Deal,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said, before she could change her mind.<br> <br>Turning onto their street, he touched the garage door opener and smiled. He would never voice it while she was still missing the kids so much, but he was beyond happy they&#x2019;d finally reached this milestone. He&#x2019;d loved every minute of raising Evan and Katie, but he was ready for it to be just the two of them again.<br> <br>He tapped the brakes, waiting for the garage door to open. Hmm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Jill&#x2019;s car wasn&#x2019;t in its bay beside his. It was after five thirty. Her conference in Kansas City had dismissed at noon, and it was barely a five-hour drive back to Sylvia. Maybe she&#x2019;d decided to pick up a few groceries on her way home. Probably got stuck in a slow checkout line at Schnucks. But she usually called if she was running late. She knew he worried about her when she was on the road.<br> <br>He pushed the remote, savoring the satisfying grind of the garage door going down on another workweek. Before he even opened the door, he heard TP&#x2019;s toenails clicking on the kitchen tile. The dog pranced a circle around him, tongue and tail wagging in unison, proving that three-year-old, fifty-pound chocolate Labs were still puppies at heart. Mitch deposited his briefcase on the island and bent to administer his daily dose of affection. &#x201c;Hey, boy, where&#x2019;s Mama?&#x201d;<br> <br>He refilled the dog&#x2019;s water bowl and checked his cell phone for messages again. Nothing. But the answering machine on the kitchen phone was blinking. Odd. They rarely used the landline. Jill usually just texted. Maybe she&#x2019;d remembered he had a meeting this afternoon and didn&#x2019;t want to bother him at work.<br> <br>He grabbed the thawed steaks from the fridge and played back the message while he mixed up his famous steak marinade.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, babe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Jill&#x2019;s voice filled the kitchen, easing the tension he hadn&#x2019;t realized was forming behind his temples. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m rushing to get packed and checked out of the hotel, but I should still be home by five&#x2014;six at the latest. Tell TP I&#x2019;m bringing him home a little treat.&#x201d; Her voice turned sultry. &#x201c;I might have a treat for you, too, Mitchell Brannon.&#x201d;<br> <br>TP sat at Mitch&#x2019;s feet, his head cocked as if he understood every word. The Lab was Jill&#x2019;s dog. TP stood for Teacher&#x2019;s Pet, although after a certain Halloween when Principal Brannon had been a target of trick-or-treaters, she&#x2019;d started telling their friends that it stood for Toilet Paper.<br> <br>Mitch chuckled at the thought, while Jill&#x2019;s cheery voice continued on the answering machine. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t mind getting the steaks started, I&#x2019;ll stop off and pick up some salad stuff. Maybe a loaf of that French bread you like from Panera. Love you. I can&#x2019;t wait to tell you about the conference. And other stuff. It was&#x2014;&#x201d; She giggled, and Mitch could almost read her thoughts. She was thinking about how much grief he always gave her for leaving &#x201c;soliloquies&#x201d; when she used voice mail.<br> <br>&#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; she said&#x2014;he could almost see her rolling her eyes&#x2014;&#x201c;It was just a really good experience. I&#x2019;ll tell you all about it when I get home.&#x201d;<br> <br>She sounded good. Really good. He&#x2019;d worried a little that Jill was taking Katie&#x2019;s leaving harder than she should, moping around the house like a mama cat looking for her kittens.<br> <br>He checked the display on the answering machine. She&#x2019;d left her message at one fifteen. Even allowing for a stop at the grocery, she should be home any minute.<br> <br>It was plenty chilly for a fire. Perfect. He went out to the back deck to bring in some of the wood he and Evan had cut last time they were at the lake cabin. He got a fire started and lit some candles on the mantel. He wished he&#x2019;d thought to pick up flowers on the way home. Candlelight and roses were usually just the ticket to a romantic evening. Though recently, with the pressure of getting Katie off to college and getting her own classroom ready for the school year, Jill seemed ticked off by his overtures more often than not. But he would take the risk tonight. Surely she guessed what his hopes were for their first weekend in a wonderfully empty nest.<br> <br>When she still wasn&#x2019;t home at six o&#x2019;clock, he called her cell phone. Voice mail again. &#x201c;Hey, babe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He cradled the phone between his ear and one shoulder while he turned the steaks in the marinade. &#x201c;Where are you? I&#x2019;m going to fire up the grill. Let me know when I should put the steaks on. For what it&#x2019;s worth, I&#x2019;m starving.&#x201d;<br> <br>He set the dining room table with the good dishes&#x2014;the ones they&#x2019;d gotten as wedding gifts&#x2014;and lit the tall candles that decorated the center of the table.<br> <br>At seven thirty, he turned off the grill and put the steaks back in the fridge. At this rate it&#x2019;d be dark before they ate. He scratched TP behind the ears. &#x201c;Sorry, boy. Guess you&#x2019;ll have to wait till tomorrow night for scraps.&#x201d; The dog whined, looking disappointed.<br> <br>The sky was clear and the rain hadn&#x2019;t amounted to anything. But maybe it was worse up near Kansas City. Mitch went into the den and checked area weather on his computer. It didn&#x2019;t look like anything to be concerned about anywhere along the route Jill would have taken. Surely the Labor Day holiday didn&#x2019;t generate enough traffic to make her this late.<br> <br>By eight o&#x2019;clock the candles were puddled on the table runner and the sun sank below the rooftops of their cul-de-sac. Still no phone call. No text. He stood at the open front door, staring down the street. The trees cast long shadows across the pavement. It would be dark in a couple of hours. He&#x2019;d left three messages on her voice mail and called the hotel to confirm she&#x2019;d checked out. She had. But they had no record of when she&#x2019;d left the hotel, since she hadn&#x2019;t turned the key in. There were no incidentals charged to the room, and the bill had been paid by the Sylvia school district.<br> <br>He paced the length of the kitchen, debating who to call next. He didn&#x2019;t have a clue which other teachers had gone to the conference, and he didn&#x2019;t want to bother Jill&#x2019;s principal if it turned out to be nothing. The last time he&#x2019;d worried over her whereabouts, she&#x2019;d been home all along, yakking over the backyard fence with Shelley next door.<br> <br>Maybe she&#x2019;d called Shelley. Those two were like sisters. He went back to Katie&#x2019;s room and parted the curtains to see if the lights were on next door. Not that he could tell if anyone was home by that. He hated to guess what the electric bills were over there. Shelley Austin kept a lamp burning in almost every room of the rambling ranch. Jill swore her friend simply liked the ambience the lamps created, but he suspected it had more to do with the fact that Shelley lived alone now that her own daughter was off at college.<br> <br>The kitchen window cast a patch of light onto the back deck of the Austin home and Mitch keyed in the number Jill had set on speed-dial for Shelley.<br> <br>&#x201c;Austins&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Shelley, it&#x2019;s Mitch. You haven&#x2019;t talked to Jill, have you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Today?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, since noon or so. She had that conference in Kansas City, you know, but I expected her home by now. I just thought she might have said something to you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, sorry. I haven&#x2019;t talked to her since the night before she left&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wednesday, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. She left on Wednesday.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did she ride with somebody? Or maybe had to drop somebody off?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d; He walked through the house and went out onto the back deck. &#x201c;She drove up by herself anyway. I don&#x2019;t think they were carpooling.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sorry. Wish I could help. I&#x2019;ll let you know if I hear from her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Shelley.&#x201d; He clicked off and dialed Jill&#x2019;s cell again, hanging up as soon as he heard her voice mail. She was going to think something was wrong when she finally checked her messages. Served her right for making him worry. He checked the clock on his phone. If she still wasn&#x2019;t home by eight thirty, he&#x2019;d call her principal. Maybe she&#x2019;d stopped by her classroom to pick up papers to grade or something.<br> <br>He poured a Coke and ate some chips and salsa. A poor substitute for a steak. At eight forty-five, he called Carol Dorchester, Jill&#x2019;s principal at the elementary school. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to bother you on the weekend, Carol, but Jill isn&#x2019;t back from that conference yet, and I just wondered if you knew whether the conference ran late or something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh? I&#x2019;m not aware that it ran over, but Jeannie Brent is the only other teacher who went from Sylvia. I heard her tell someone that Bill was meeting her in Kansas City for the weekend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s right. I think Jill said something about that. Okay, well, thanks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;ll be home soon. Again, I apologize for calling on the weekend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, heavens, don&#x2019;t mention it. Let me know if she&#x2019;s not home in an hour or so.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mitch hung up feeling a little foolish. He&#x2019;d completely forgotten about Jill telling him Bill and Jeannie were staying in Kansas City for the weekend. She often accused him of not really listening to her. And too often he was guilty as charged. Maybe she&#x2019;d told him something about where she was tonight and he&#x2019;d forgotten that, too. But if that was true, she wouldn&#x2019;t have left a message on the answering machine saying she&#x2019;d be home by five or six and then not call to let him know she was going to be three hours late. And they did have a date planned.<br> <br>Maybe she&#x2019;d called one of the kids on the way home and pulled over to talk. He dialed Katie&#x2019;s cell phone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Papacito! What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hearing her chipper voice made him realize how much he missed his little girl already. &#x201c;Hey, kiddo. You haven&#x2019;t talked to Mom tonight, have you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Why?&#x201d; His daughter&#x2019;s voice turned wary. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s going on. I just wondered if you&#x2019;d heard from her. She&#x2019;s on her way home from that conference in Kansas City and I keep getting her voice mail when I call.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She probably forgot to charge her stupid phone again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I figured. So how&#x2019;s everything going with you?&#x201d; He changed the subject quickly, relieved Katie had assumed the same as he. &#x201c;Did you get all your textbooks bought?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. My. Gosh. Dad, do you know how much they charge for those things? My psychology book was almost a hundred bucks. I&#x2019;m talking for one book!&#x201d;<br> <br>He chuckled. &#x201c;Why do you think we made you pay for books?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, next time I&#x2019;ll trade you, and I&#x2019;ll pay tuition. It&#x2019;d be cheaper!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not hardly. You talk to your brother lately?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; He could picture the familiar drama queen eye roll. &#x201c;I try to avoid Big Brother at all costs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unless you need wheels, of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>She laughed, sounding caught.<br> <br>&#x201c;So everything&#x2019;s going good? You&#x2019;ve had a good week?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. It&#x2019;s going real good. Calculus is gonna stink, but I like my other classes so far. And my roommate is cool. Hey, Dad, let me talk to TP.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it with you Brannon women? If I didn&#x2019;t know better, I&#x2019;d think you and Mom like that dog better than you like me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Daddy. Please? He misses me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. I am not putting a dog on the phone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Dad&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked over to see TP staring up at him with sad eyes, ears drooping. &#x201c;Sorry, he&#x2019;s on the other line. I&#x2019;ll have him call you back later.&#x201d; He laughed at his own joke.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re mean.&#x201d; But he heard the smile in her voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, but no go. You&#x2014;&#x201d; He stopped to listen, thinking he heard the garage door. &#x201c;Hey, Katiebug, I think Mom&#x2019;s home. I&#x2019;ll let you go, but glad everything&#x2019;s going good. Mom will probably want to call you later this weekend, so we&#x2019;ll talk more then, okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. &#x2019;Bye, Daddy. Love you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The lump that came to his throat at her endearment took him by surprise&#x2014;and made him a little more sympathetic to all the moping Jill had done lately.<br> <br>He hung up and went to open the door that led from the kitchen to the garage. He flipped on the lights. But the garage door was closed and Jill&#x2019;s side was still empty. Apparently it had been wishful thinking. It was pitch black outside now, and the garage windows formed dark rectangles between the tools and lawn chairs hanging on the walls.<br> <br>It was after nine o&#x2019;clock. Jill should have been home four hours ago.

Fire cracker plants grew around the wall, useful for starting fires in the mornings, and the crackers tasted good too. The connected orchard had pie trees of the most sinfully delicious varieties. The mistress of the household was exactly as beautiful, devoted, and accommodating as her husband desired. A man could hardly ask for a better situation.Except for one or two small things. "Where is your worser half?" Veleno muttered, looking apprehensively around."Don't worry," the Demoness Metria replied with a smile as her scant clothing shimmered into nothingness. "I sent Mentia off to see the Demon Grossclout about our other problem.""Other problem?"She pretended not to hear. "Grossclout's such an intractable cuss that it should take her days to pry any kind of an answer from him.""That's a relief!" he said, looking more than relieved. "It's not that I want to be critical, but--""But Mentia is slightly crazy," Metria finished. "And you married me, not my worser half. But because she did fission off from me, being disgusted by my new goody-goody attitude after I got half your soul, we can't keep her away. She's the half of me you naturally don't like--the soulless half, dedicated to making your life half-muled.""Half-whatted?""Horsed, equined, donkeyed, asinined--"He kissed her. "I think I could fathom the word if I concentrated. Let's make hay while the sun shines."She looked perplexed. "Hay? I thought you had something else in mind." A tantalizing wisp of strategically placed clothing appeared."I love it when you tease me," he said, picking her up and carrying her to the. master bedroom.She assumed the form of a nymph. "Eeeeek!" she cried faintly, kicking her marvelous bare legs in the nymphly way. "Whatever am I going to do?""You're going to make me deliriously happy, you luscious creature."She inhaled, enhancing what hardly needed it. "O, sigh, how can I escape this hideous fate?" she wailed cutely, kissing him on eye, ear, nose, and throat.They fell together on the bed, in a tangle of limbs, faces, kisses, and whatnot. "You are the best thing that ever happened to me," Veleno gasped around the activity."You're just the most wonderful, beautiful, lovable, exciting, fantastic person in all Xanth!""You damn me with faint praise," she muttered, clasping him with such ardor that description would be improper.Another demoness popped into the chamber. "Oh, there you are, Metria!" she exclaimed. "No wonder I couldn't findyou around the grounds. I have brought you what you most vitally need."Veleno stiffened, but not in the way he desired. "Oh, no!"Metria looked up from what was occupying her. "At the least opportune time, of course. Do you mind, worser half? I happen to be busy at the moment."Mentia peered closely. "Oh? Doing what?""Making my husband deliriously happy, of course, as only a demoness can.""When not being annoyingly interrupted," Veleno muttered.Mentia peered again. "Sorry. I thought that was a grimace of pain on what's-his-name's face. Are you sure you are doing an adequate job, better half?""Of course I'm sure!" Metria said indignantly. "He has not complained once in seven hundred and fifty times during the past year.""Oh? What about that groan he groaned just now?""That was when you appeared!""Well, if you feel that way, I'll just depart with what I brought, and never never return.""Oop, no!" Metria cried with alarm. "I need it!"Her husband, somewhat bemused by the interruption, put in two more words. "Need what?""Never mind," Metria said."It's a soldier matter.""A what matter?" he asked."Secluded, cloistered, isolated, remote, detached, obscure--""Private?""Whatever," she agreed crossly."But what could be private from your husband?" he asked somewhat querulously."Yes, whatever could you be suspiciously concealing from your trusting spouse?" Mentia echoed."Can't we have this discussion some other time?" Metria demanded, frustrated."Of course, dear," Mentia agreed. "I'll pop back in during the next century." She began to fuzz out."No, wait!" Metria cried. "Now will do after all.""Why, how nice," Mentia said, smiling with something more than good nature. "But don't you think you should introduce us first?""Whatever for? He knows who the mischief you are, from ever since you returned from that madness with the gargoyle.""Yes, but he may have forgotten. I've been away a whole hour, you know.""That long?" Veleno inquired with resignation.Metria gritted her teeth. There was nothing half so annoying as half a demoness! But she knew her worser half would not give over until she had her half-baked way. "Veleno, this is the Demoness Mentia, my soulless worser half, who represents what I was like before I got half-souled, except that she has no problem with vocational.""With what?""Idiom, language, speech, expression, locution, utterance, articulation--""Words?""Whatever. Instead, she's slightly crazy.""Yes, it's my talent," Mentia agreed proudly."And, Mentia, this is my husband Veleno, formerly a nymphomaniac, but he hasn't touched a nymph since I married him and took half his soul.""Yes, but hasn't he looked at nymphs out the window, with a glint in his--?""Pleased to meet you," Veleno gritted, drawing free a hand and extending it. "Now will you begone?""Charmed, I'm sure," Mentia said, forming a pair of pincers on the end of her arm."Ixnay," Metria murmured warningly. "Mortals are protected from harm in this castle.""Oh, that's right," Mentia agreed, disappointed. The pincers became an ordinary hand, which shook Veleno's hand. "That was one of the conditions of the restoration. Well,now that your mortal man and I have been properly introduced, I will give you what you most need, Metria."At last! But Metria still wasn't easy about this. "Veleno, dearest, why don't you take a little snooze for the moment?" Metria suggested dulcetly, covering his eyes with her hand."But what could you need that I have not provided?" he asked, frowning."Yes, I'm sure he will be really, truly interested in this very important secret matter," Mentia said, sitting on the edge of the bed, so that her thigh touched Veleno."Oh, all <i>right,"</i> Metria said, really crossly."Have no concern, dear, I will explain it excruciatingly clearly," Mentia said. "What I bring is information to help abate your incapacity, so you won't be a failure anymore.""What incapacity?" Veleno demanded. "My wife has made me deliriously happy almost continuously since we married.""That is the problem," Mentia said. "She has helped you with the chore of summoning the stork seven hundred and fifty--" she peered again "--and a half times this year, and more times during the prior year when I was too busy to be with her, unfortunately, and yet the stork has not gotten the message. She is clearly inadequate in this department."Veleno pondered, slowly realizing the truth of this statement. "That hadn't occurred to me," he said. "I was too delirious to think of the stork. But how could it fail to get the messages?""That is precisely what Metria wants to know," Mentia said. "Whatever could be wrong with her to bomb so badly in so many attempts? Whatever could make her such a sore loser? Especially when I could so readily have--""Nuh-uh!" Metria and Veleno said together."So she sent me to ask the most intelligent creature she knows, the Demon Grossclout, for advice," Mentia continued without concern, "and he instantly delegated me to convey that essential advice to her. Naturally I delayed not half a whit to honor that stricture. Her failing is simply too serious to permit any delay.""Thank you so much, Worser," Metria snarled."You are so welcome, Better. I knew you would want to attend to your washout without delay." Mentia's form fuzzed, and assumed the likeness of a giant lemon, then a cooked turkey. "I am thrilled to have been of so much help.""You haven't been of much help yet," Metria said grimly. "What did Grossclout <i>say</i>?""Oh, that. He says you should go ask Good Magician Humfrey.""But Humfrey charges a year's service for a single Answer!" Metria protested."I don't want to pay that! That's why I went to Grossclout.""Grossclout did add a few words," Mentia said. "I believe those words were <i>mush-head, cheapskate, and serve her right."</i>"That's Grossclout, all right," Metria agreed."He still holds a grudge just because I chose to sand my nails in his dull magic classes at Demon U.""Actually, that was I who did that," Mentia said, smiling reminiscently. "Back when we were inextricably bound together as alternate aspects of a single demoness. Those were the days! But I did not see fit to remind the Professor of that." She paused reflectively. "I might be able to remember a few more of his words, if it's really important," she offered helpfully."Thank you so much, no," Metria said."I think I have fathomed his altitude.""His what?""Manner, disposition, temperament, bent, inclination, penchant--""Attitude?" Veleno inquired."Whatever," Metria said crossly."From the height of his eminence," Mentia agreed. "Well, if you need no further assistance or advice on technique--""None!" Metria said."Too bad." Mentia faded out"You want the stork to deliver a baby?" Veleno inquired as Metria resumed activity."Yes. It's what married couples do. Raise children.""But demonesses don't get babies unless they want them.""Precisely. I want one." She looked away. "I suppose I should have told you, and I can't blame you for being angry.""But I'm not angry.""You aren't? But it might interrupt the delirium, and give you the solid obligation of raising a child.""Exactly! I want a family, now that it occurs to me."Metria gazed at him with adoration tinged substantially with relief. "Wonderful!"Now he was thoughtful. "The stork must figure that our signals aren't serious.""Which is ironic, considering how strong we have made them. I've just got to get the stork's distention!""The stork's what?""Observation, mindfulness, notice, focus, application--""Attention?""Whatever. What do you think I should do?"He considered. "I think you should go to ask the Good Magician.""But then I would have to leave you alone for a year.""Surely you could return on occasion. It might mean you could make me deliriously happy only three or four hundred times in that year, but I think I can survive that deprivation. After all, I want you to be happy too.""You dear wonderful man!" she exclaimed, and proceeded to do the impossible: to make him twice as delirious as before. But before she went, she checked around the premises, debating with herself, because her worser half had decided to unify for the occasion, now that there was a chance her lifewould become interesting again. 'Do I really want to do this?' Metria asked herself.'Why not? It isn't as if you have anything important to do around here.' Mentia had fissioned off in disgust when Metria married, got half a soul, and fell in love, in that order. Her worser half claimed to have been on a grand adventure with a gargoyle, and helped save all Xanth from madness, but that was surely an exaggeration. She had merged as soon as Metria stopped being nauseatingly nice to her husband.'If you had half a soul, you would have a different alti--attitude.''Praise the Demon X(A/N)th that I have not been corrupted with any portion of a soul,' Mentia agreed. Their dialogue was silent because it was internal; no one else could overhear it. She pointed with their left hand. 'There's a sand worm; step on it.''I will not,' Metria retorted. 'That wouldn't be nice.' She lifted the worm carefully with their right hand and inspected it. It was, of course, made of sand; if direct sunlight or water touched it, it would powder or dissolve away. So she put it back in a dry shaded section, and watched it wiggle off.'Disgusting,' Mentia remarked to no one else in particular. 'But you can redeem your demonly nature by squishing that June bug.''No way. Kill a June bug and the year loses its most romantic month.'Mentia grimaced with the left side of their face. 'I'd rather have you half-bottomed than half-souled.' She looked around, using Metria's left eye. 'I see that go-quat tree is fruiting.''So is the come-quat tree,' Metria agreed. 'Veleno likes them, when he's coming and going.''Which is he doing when he's alone with you?''The opposite of what he wants you to be doing.'But Mentia could not be shamed. 'Here is my favorite: the grapes with an attitude.''Sour grapes,' Metria agreed. 'Your kind.''So why are you dawdling around here, instead of getting moving to the Good Magician's castle?''I'm just not sure it's right to leave my husband on half rations.''There's all the food he needs, growing right around the castle here.''Half rations of delirium.''Oh.' Mentia looked around again, until the left eyeball was oriented completely to the side. 'Let's make it easy, then. See that winged nut tree?'The right eye swiveled. 'Of course. The nuts are almost as nutty as you are.''If the right wing nut flies first, we stay right here. If the left one flies first, we pop over to see the Good Magician.''That would be a crazy way to make such an important decision.''Precisely. Agreed?'Metria sighed. It was as good a way as any. 'Agreed.'They watched the two nuts quiver. The right one spread its wings. Then suddenly the left one lurched into the air and flew across to the nearby bolt tree. 'How romantic,' Mentia said, amused by what the boldest bolt did with the nut.'Why don't you find it romantic when Veleno and I--''Once is amusing. Seven hundred and fifty times is droll.''Not when you're in love.''I'm glad I'll never be in love. Let's be on our way.'Metria couldn't dawdle any longer, even if it did seem somewhat nutty or screwed up. The Good Magician's castle looked ordinary. Its wall and turrets were set within a sparkling circular moat, which in turn was inside a ring of mountains. Neither would be any problem for a demoness to pop across.But Metria was unable to pop across. When she tried, she bounced off an invisible barrier. 'Dam, I forgot!' she swore. 'The old fool has a shield against demonly intrusion.''That's what you consider swearing? That's not even worthy of the Juvenile Conspiracy.'Worse, she was unable to fly or dematerialize in this vicinity. Obviously the Good Magician had improved his defe...</p><h2>The Sacred Mushroom &amp; the Cross</h2><p>Autor: Strani John M.

It's even harder for a robot named Mack Megaton, a hulking machine designed to bring mankind to its knees. But Mack's not interested in world domination. He's just a bot trying to get by, trying to demonstrate that he isn't just an automated smashing machine, and to earn his citizenship in the process. It should be as easy as crushing a tank for Mack, but some bots just can't catch a break.</p><p>When Mack's neighbors are kidnapped, Mack sets off on a journey through the dark alleys and gleaming skyscrapers of Empire City. Along the way, he runs afoul of a talking gorilla, a brainy dame, a mutant lowlife, a little green mob boss, and the secret conspiracy at the heart of Empire's founders---not to mention more trouble than he bargained for. What started out as one missing family becomes a battle for the future of Empire and every citizen that calls her home.</p></p><p><p><b>A. Lee Martinez</b> lives in Terrell, Texas.</p><p>Chapter 1<br>The Learned Council had an official name for Empire City.<br>Technotopia.<br>Yeah, it wasn&#x2019;t a real word, but that was kind of the point. The Council loved to reinvent things, improve them, make them new and snazzy. Of course Empire had a lot of unofficial nicknames as well.<br>Mutantburg. Robotville. The Big Gray Haze. The City That Never Functions.<br>But Technotopia was the official party line, along with the motto &#x201c;Building Tomorrow&#x2019;s Town. Today.&#x201d; I guess it all depended on what you thought the future should look like. If you were looking for a bright and shiny metropolis where all of civilization&#x2019;s problems had been solved through the wise and fortuitous applications of equal parts science, wisdom, and compassion, then I guess you&#x2019;d be out of luck. But if your ideal tomorrow was a sprawling, impersonal city with rampant pollution, unchecked mutation, and dangerous and unreliable weird science, then I guess you would be right at home.<br>Name&#x2019;s Mack Megaton. I&#x2019;m a bot. Or automated citizen, as the Learned Council liked to phrase it. There were three classes of robot in Empire. You had your drones: low sophistication models geared toward mundane tasks. Then there were the autos: humanoid models designed for more complex work. Then you had your bots: autos and drones that qualified for citizenship. I hadn&#x2019;t quite reached bot status yet, but so far my probation had been going smoothly, and I was only forty-six months, six days, four hours, and twenty-two minutes from crossing that objective. I occupied a more vague class between auto and citizen. I couldn&#x2019;t vote, couldn&#x2019;t hold public office, and if the Learned Council decided to issue a recall, there wasn&#x2019;t much I could do about it.<br>I was barely two years old and weighed a compact seven hundred and sixteen pounds. That&#x2019;s light when you&#x2019;re seven feet tall and made entirely of metal. I could punch through concrete and bend steel. I could not, however, tie a bow tie. My programming was state of the art: adaptive, intuitive, evolutionary. I wasn&#x2019;t programmed knowing how to drive a cab, and I got along just fine doing that. I wasn&#x2019;t designed to play poker, and I was a decent card sharp, though it&#x2019;s easier to bluff when you have a featureless faceplate. But my artificial intelligence couldn&#x2019;t wrap its binary digits around the ins and outs of getting a bow tie on. My hands didn&#x2019;t help any. They weren&#x2019;t designed for delicate work, more like sledgehammers with fingers. But the Bluestar Cab Company insisted all its drivers wear bow ties. Real, honest-to-God bow ties. No clip-ons. That&#x2019;s what got me involved in the mess.<br>A bot&#x2019;s got bills to pay. Bill, really. I used to be juiced by a small atomic power core. That was gone now. The Learned Council removed it as part of the terms of my probation. But I still consumed a lot of electricity in a day, and it didn&#x2019;t come cheap. Not in Empire. There was barely enough to go around in this town. To get my fair share to keep up and running costs plenty. It was fortunate that I didn&#x2019;t have many other expenses or I&#x2019;d have never been able to support myself driving a cab. As it was, I usually had to operate at half-power. Used to feel sluggish doing that, but I&#x2019;d gotten adjusted to it.<br>So every morning at the end of my recharge cycle, I&#x2019;d get shined up and dressed for work and head out the door. And along the way, I&#x2019;d stop by my neighbor&#x2019;s apartment and have Julie wrap that tie around my barely existent neck. She didn&#x2019;t mind. She was the nicest, warmest person I&#x2019;d met in Empire. Every time I scanned her, I was always glad I hadn&#x2019;t gone with my original program and led that robot army.<br>She was always expecting me, usually already waiting with a smile and a friendly word. Today, she wasn&#x2019;t. No big deal. Probably just busy. Those two kids were a handful sometimes. And her husband wasn&#x2019;t much help.<br>I knocked on the door. No one answered. My internal chronometer counted off sixty seconds before I knocked again. It was another thirty-six seconds before the door slid open and Julie stuck her head out. By then my intuition simulator started beeping. When that little ping went off in my right audio sensor, it usually meant trouble. I couldn&#x2019;t turn the damn thing off, so I did my best to ignore it.<br>&#x201c;Mack.&#x201d; She looked surprised to see me. &#x201c;Oh, Mack, I&#x2019;m sorry. I forgot.&#x201d;<br>She slid the door wide enough to step out and shut it before I could catch a view inside. She snatched the bow tie from my large metal hands and started to tie it. She fidgeted a bit, glanced back at her closed door.<br>&#x201c;Everything all right, Jules?&#x201d; I asked, despite my better judgment.<br>She laughed, trying to pass it off as casual, but it came out anxious. &#x201c;Oh, everything&#x2019;s fine, Mack. Thanks for asking.&#x201d;<br>I was pretty good at reading people. I had a peachy little voice and body language analyzer subroutine that rarely failed, but I didn&#x2019;t need it for this because Julie was a bad liar.<br>I&#x2019;d done my part. I&#x2019;d asked. It wasn&#x2019;t any of my business now. Probably nothing serious anyway. Stress is stress. The biological body reacts the same way no matter the source, whether being chased by a bear or in the middle of a domestic tiff. Julie and her husband fought a lot.<br>But Julie always smiled for me. Always. She was smiling now, but it wasn&#x2019;t the same. My analyzer didn&#x2019;t bother spelling it out to me, but it encouraged that pinging in my audio to get louder.<br>&#x201c;There you go, Mack. Sorry, it&#x2019;s a little crooked, but I&#x2019;m kind of busy right now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No problem, Jules. Thanks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Another furtive glance at that door. &#x201c;Have a great day.&#x201d;<br>I was about to return the sentiment but she disappeared into her apartment before I got the chance.<br>&#x201c;Mind your own business, Mack,&#x201d; I said.<br>Talking to myself was a bad habit. You&#x2019;d be surprised at the extraneous behaviors that make it into your personality template when you hang around with biologicals. My intuition must&#x2019;ve caught the hint though, because it stopped beeping.<br>I adjusted my tie, careful not to loosen it or else I&#x2019;d have to knock on the door again. I wasn&#x2019;t built for stealth, and the strange yellowish metal they use for flooring in the cheaper apartment complexes squeaks when I walk on it. Despite the noise and my stalwart vow to keep my nose clean (which should have been easy since I didn&#x2019;t have a nose), I heard something break in Julie&#x2019;s apartment. A plate or piece of glassware falling off a table. Nothing serious.<br>I stopped, cranked my hearing to the max. My audio array isn&#x2019;t much better than human hearing, but I&#x2019;ve got a directional mic. It doesn&#x2019;t penetrate steel doors. Everything in Empire, even the doors, was made of metal.<br>Muffled voices. Julie&#x2019;s. Gavin, her husband. Holt, one of the kids. Somebody else I didn&#x2019;t know. Another round of shattering glass. And another. Then a stifled scream. The wet slap of meat hitting meat, somebody getting hit. Crying.<br>My intuition simulator didn&#x2019;t fire up again. No need for it. I didn&#x2019;t need a ping to tell me there was a problem.<br>Consciousness is a quagmire, whether found in squishy organic tissue or an interminable string of squirming electrons. I don&#x2019;t know where logic is found in the human brain, and I don&#x2019;t understand the inner workings of my own electronic brain either. It&#x2019;s dozens upon dozens of programs interacting, prioritizing, compiling, doing lots of other technical stuff. Somewhere in my common sense replicator, in that ricocheting string of ones and zeroes, there must&#x2019;ve been a digit missing, and as I moved back toward Julie&#x2019;s apartment, I cursed Professor Megalith for not spending more time in beta testing.<br>I knocked. It got quiet inside real fast. The door slid open. Julie stuck out her head.<br>&#x201c;Is everything all right, Jules?&#x201d; I asked again.<br>She answered the same way. &#x201c;Yeah, yeah. It&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s Gavin?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br>We didn&#x2019;t say anything for a bit (four seconds for those of you without a built-in clock), but I could record crying still coming from inside. April, their daughter: one of the top voices in my recognition file. Hearing her sob quietly made me glad I was doing this. But what was I doing?<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a problem, Mack,&#x201d; said Julie. &#x201c;Thanks anyway.&#x201d;<br>Empire was a progressive town. It&#x2019;s the only city in the world where a robot could earn full citizenship rights. But I was built for world domination, and I couldn&#x2019;t blame the authorities for wanting some time to see if I was truly interested in reforming. I had another four years probation left before the law considered me safe enough for citizenship consideration. If I blew it, there&#x2019;d be no place left for me to go where I wouldn&#x2019;t be just another piece of property, an unlicensed weapon with a mind of its own, headed for the scrap heap.<br>If I barged into that apartment, I&#x2019;d blow it, but if I wasn&#x2019;t going to follow through, I shouldn&#x2019;t have come back in the first place.<br>Julie tried to slide the door shut, but I thrust my hand against the jamb. I didn&#x2019;t ask to come in. I pushed it open and stepped inside.<br>The apartment, like 92 percent of all apartments in Empire, was one room partitioned into various areas. Except the bathroom, which was a metal box (always metal) in the corner about the size of three phone booths put together. It didn&#x2019;t take long to sweep the place with my opticals and see the problem. It wasn&#x2019;t Gavin, as I&#x2019;d first assumed. He slouched in a chair. He held a hand clamped over his mouth, and blood dripped down his chin. I...</p></p><h2>10,000 Days of Thunder: A History of the Vietnam War</h2><p>It was the war that lasted ten thousand days. The war that inspired scores of songs. The war that sparked dozens of riots. And in this stirring chronicle, Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist Philip Caputo writes about our country's most controversial war -- the Vietnam War -- for young readers. From the first stirrings of unrest in Vietnam under French colonial rule, to American intervention, to the battle at Hamburger Hill, to the Tet Offensive, to the fall of Saigon, <i>10,000 Days of Thunder</i> explores the war that changed the lives of a generation of Americans and that still reverberates with us today. <br> Included within <i>10,000 Days of Thunder</i> are personal anecdotes from soldiers and civilians, as well as profiles and accounts of the actions of many historical luminaries, both American and Vietnamese, involved in the Vietnam War, such as Richard M. Nixon, General William C. Westmoreland, Ho Chi Minh, Joe Galloway, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Lyndon B. Johnson, and General Vo Nguyen Giap. Caputo also explores the rise of Communism in Vietnam, the roles that women played on the battlefield, the antiwar movement at home, the participation of Vietnamese villagers in the war, as well as the far-reaching impact of the war's aftermath. <br> Caputo's dynamic narrative is highlighted by stunning photographs and key campaign and battlefield maps, making <i>10,000 Days of Thunder</i> THE consummate book on the Vietnam War for kids.</p><p><b>Philip Caputo</b> shared a Pulitzer Prize in 1973, when he was a reporter for the <i>Chicago Tribune. A Rumor of War,</i> a memoir of his service during the Vietnam War as a marine lieutenant, has become a classic with more than two million copies sold since its publication in 1977. Philip Caputo's most recent novel is <i>Acts of Faith.</i> He is also the author of nine other books: <i>Horn of Africa, DelCorso's Gallery, Indian Country, Means of Escape, Equation for Evil, Exiles, The Voyage, In the Shadows of the Morning,</i> and <i>Ghosts of Tsavo.</i> He lives in Connecticut.Starred Review. Grade 5 Up&#x2013;In this truly multifaceted presentation of the conflict, both on the front lines and on the homefront, Caputo has produced what is at once an overview and a sensitive, resonant picture of the war as seen and experienced by American soldiers, the Viet Cong, North Vietnamese guerrillas, and the citizens of both South Vietnam and the United States. Covering the period from the rise of Bolshevism in Russia in the early 20th century to the American normalization of relations with Vietnam in 1995, it's an ideal source for both information and understanding. Beginning with an affecting introduction, the author then gives a history of communism and the origins of the war. Following this, the American involvement in Vietnam is traced in numerous two- to four-page sections dealing with various aspects of the conflict, such as the Viet Cong, the Ho Chi Minh Trail and the DMZ, and the draft. Each section has a quick facts box that highlights the main issues surrounding each topic. Caputo's prose is clear and direct, and the award-winning photos, both black and white and color, add an immediacy that sets this title apart from more conventional treatments. The glossary is detailed and informative, and the bibliography is a veritable gold mine of sound sources. This is the book of choice for libraries serving today's students.<i>&#x2013;Ann Welton, Grant Elementary School, Tacoma, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Someday she expects to sit on the throne and rule the vast Byzantine Empire. So the birth of a baby brother doesn't perturb her. Nor do the "barbarians" from foreign lands, who think only a son should ascend to power. Anna is as dismissive of them as are her father and his most trusted adviser--his mother, a manipulative woman with whom Anna studies the art of diplomacy. Anna relishes her lessons, proving adept at checkmating opponents in swift moves of mental chess. But as she matures into a young woman, her arrogance and intelligence threaten her grandmother. Anna will be no one's puppet. Almost overnight, Anna sees her dreams of power wrenched from her and bestowed on her little brother. Bitter at the betrayal, Anna waits to avenge herself, and to seize what is rightfully hers.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Tracy Barrett holds a Ph.D. in Italian from the University of California at Berkeley.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i>Grade 6-10-The 11th-century Byzantine princess Anna Comnena was a remarkable woman. Designated as a child to inherit the throne, she was educated to be a ruler. She learned, from her mother and grandmother, to manipulate the intrigues and factions of the court, and when she was displaced as heir by her brother, she schemed, without success, to assassinate him and regain her position. In this novel, Anna tells her own story, looking back on her former life from the convent to which she has been banished. The first-person device serves well to focus the action on the princess and to build a plausible character study of a brilliant and tempestuous young woman frustrated and embittered by the loss of her expectations of achieving supreme power. However, the book exemplifies the difficulty of writing a historical novel about a real person. Anna's brother is depicted throughout as a spoiled monster who (in contrast to the brilliant Anna) refuses to learn to read. Yet historians characterize John's rule as one of personal virtue and administrative competence and tell that he forgave his sister for her many conspiracies against him. Barrett acknowledges in an afterword that she "changed some of the facts," but, unfortunately, it is the story she spins that will remain with young readers. Still, few books, with the notable exception of Peter Dickinson's The Dancing Bear (Little, Brown, 1972; o.p.), have as their backdrop the colorful and historically significant Byzantine Empire.<br><i>Shirley Wilton, Ocean County College, Toms River, NJ </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ashes to Fire Devotional, Year A: Daily Reflections from Ash Wednesday to Pentecost</h2><p>This 14-week devotional book includes daily scripture readings from the Old Testament and New Testament, prayers, and each Sunday, a small sermon with journaling space.This book is specifically designed to be used, either individually or for small groups, from Ash Wednesday to Pentecost.Ashes to Fire allows adults and youth to reflect on what God is teaching them instead of just feeding them another video clip or media outlet.
